## Overview

Use the `<ImageCard>` component to display image cards on a page.

The Image Card differs from markdown's standard image insertion method by presenting more information
related to the image, including title, description, author, link, etc.
It is suitable for scenarios such as photography works, design works, promotional posters, and more.

  description="The lighthouse in today's photo is located at Cabo de São Vicente in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. The Alfanzina Lighthouse, built in 1919, shines over the sea, helping vessels navigate the treacherous waters around the area.

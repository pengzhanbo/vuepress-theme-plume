## Overview

The theme supports embedding [markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) mind maps within articles.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/markdown/markdown-chart/).

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default in the theme.

You need to install `markmap-lib`, `markmap-toolbar` and `markmap-view` in your project:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i markmap-lib markmap-toolbar markmap-view
```

:::

Then, enable the feature in the `.vuepress/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      markmap: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

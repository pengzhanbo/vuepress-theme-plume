## Overview

Article comments are powered by [@vuepress/plugin-comment](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/).

The theme has built-in plugin support, so you can use it without reinstalling.

In this theme, configure through the following fields:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    comment: {
      // Service provider
      provider: '', // "Artalk" | "Giscus" | "Twikoo" | "Waline"
      // Whether comments are enabled by default
      comment: true,

      // Other configurations based on the service provider
      // ...
    }
  })
})
```

### Service Providers

[@vuepress/plugin-comment](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/) supports various
comment service providers such as `"Artalk" | "Giscus" | "Twikoo" | "Waline"`.

You can configure based on your requirements.

- `Giscus` is a comment system based on GitHub Discussions, easy to set up. [View documentation](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/giscus/)
- `Waline` is a comment system that requires a backend, offering higher security. [View documentation](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/waline/)
- `Twikoo` is a concise, secure, free static website comment system based on Tencent Cloud Base. [View documentation](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/twikoo/)
- `Artalk` is a concise self-hosted comment system that you can easily deploy on your server and embed in frontend pages. [View documentation](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/artalk/)

## Giscus

Giscus is a comment system based on GitHub Discussions, easy to set up.

### Prerequisites

::: steps

1. You need to create a public repository and enable Discussions to serve as the location for storing comments.

2. You need to install the [Giscus App](https://github.com/apps/giscus) to grant it permission to access the corresponding repository.

3. After completing the above steps, go to the [Giscus page](https://giscus.app/zh-CN) to get your settings.

   You only need to fill in the repository and Discussion category, then scroll to the "Enable giscus" section
   at the bottom of the page to obtain the four attributes: `data-repo`, `data-repo-id`, `data-category`, and `data-category-id`.

:::

### Configuration

Set `provider: 'Giscus'` and pass `data-repo`, `data-repo-id`, `data-category`, and `data-category-id` as
plugin options to `repo`, `repoId`, `category`, and `categoryId`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    comment: {
      provider: 'Giscus', // "Artalk" | "Giscus" | "Twikoo" | "Waline"
      comment: true,
      repo: 'Your_Repo', // [!code ++]
      repoId: 'Your_RepoId', // [!code ++]
      category: 'Your_Category', // [!code ++]
      categoryId: 'Your_CategoryId', // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

### Themes

By default, Giscus uses `light` or `dark` themes (based on the dark mode state).

If you want to customize themes for light and dark modes, you can set the `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` options
using built-in theme keywords or custom CSS links starting with `https://`.

## Waline

A secure comment system with a backend.

### Installation

If you want to use Waline in the theme, you need to install `@waline/client` first.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i @waline/client
```

### LeanCloud Setup (Database)

::: steps

1. [Login](https://console.leancloud.app/login) or [Register](https://console.leancloud.app/register) for
   `LeanCloud International` and enter the [Console](https://console.leancloud.app/apps)

2. Click [Create Application](https://console.leancloud.app/apps) in the upper left corner and choose a name
   you like (please select the free development plan):

   ![Create Application](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/assets/leancloud-1-D6GvqV4-.png)

3. Enter the application, select `Settings` > `Application Keys` in the lower left corner.
   You can see your `APP ID`, `APP Key`, and `Master Key`. Please record them for later use.

::: warning Domestic version requires ICP filing

If you are using the LeanCloud domestic version ([leancloud.cn](https://leancloud.cn)), we recommend
switching to the international version ([leancloud.app](https://leancloud.app)).
Otherwise, you need to bind an **already ICP-filed** domain to the application, purchase an independent IP, and complete the ICP filing process:

- Log in to the domestic version and enter the application you need to use
- Select `Settings` > `Domain Binding` > `API Access Domain` > `Bind New Domain` > Enter domain > `OK`.
- Follow the instructions on the page to complete the CNAME resolution in DNS as required.
- Purchase an independent IP and submit a work order to complete the ICP filing. (The current price for an independent IP is Â¥50/month)

### Vercel Deployment (Server)

[![Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwalinejs%2Fwaline%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexample)

:::: steps

1. Click the button above to jump to Vercel for server-side deployment.

   ::: note

   If you are not logged in, Vercel will prompt you to register or log in. Please use your GitHub account for quick login.

   :::

2. Enter a Vercel project name you like and click `Create` to continue:

   ![Create Project](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-1.png)

3. At this point, Vercel will help you create and initialize a repository based on the Waline template,
with the repository name being the project name you entered earlier.

   ![deploy](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-3.png)

   After a minute or two, a full screen of fireworks will celebrate your successful deployment.
   Click `Go to Dashboard` to jump to the application's console.

   ![deploy](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-4.png)

4. Click `Settings` at the top - `Environment Variables` to enter the environment variable configuration page,
   and configure the three environment variables `LEAN_ID`, `LEAN_KEY`, and `LEAN_MASTER_KEY`.
   Their values correspond to the `APP ID`, `APP KEY`, and `Master Key` obtained from LeanCloud in the previous step, respectively.

   ![Set Environment Variables](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-5.png)

   ::: note

   If you are using the LeanCloud domestic version, please additionally configure the `LEAN_SERVER`
   environment variable with the value of your bound domain.

   :::

5. After configuring the environment variables, click `Deployments` at the top,
   then click the `Redeploy` button on the right side of the latest deployment to redeploy.
   This step is to make the environment variables you just set take effect.

   ![redeploy](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-6.png)

6. At this point, it will jump to the `Overview` interface to start deployment.
   Wait a moment until the `STATUS` becomes `Ready`. Then click `Visit` to jump to the deployed
   website address, which is your server address.

   ![redeploy success](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-7.png)

### Domain Binding (Optional)

::: steps

1. Click `Settings` - `Domains` at the top to enter the domain configuration page.

2. Enter the domain you want to bind and click `Add`.

   ![Add domain](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-8.png)

   | Type  | Name    | Value                |
   | ----- | ------- | -------------------- |
   | CNAME | example | cname.vercel-dns.com |

4. Wait for it to take effect. You can now access it via your own domain :tada:

   - Comment system: example.your-domain.com
   - Comment management: example.your-domain.com/ui

### Client

#### Using the Plugin

Set `provider: "Waline"` in the plugin options, and set the server address `serverURL` to the value obtained in the previous step.

At this point, place the `<CommentService>` component in a suitable location on your website
(usually at the bottom of the page) to use the Waline comment functionality.

::: tip

You can also pass other options supported by Waline (except `el`). For details, see [Waline Configuration](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/waline/config.html).

:::

### Comment Management (Admin Panel)

::: steps

1. After deployment is complete, please visit `<serverURL>/ui/register` to register. The first person to register will be set as the administrator.

2. After logging in as an administrator, you can see the comment management interface. Here you can modify, mark, or delete comments.

3. Users can also register accounts through the comment box. After logging in, they will be redirected to their own profile page.

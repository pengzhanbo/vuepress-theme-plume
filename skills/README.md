## 5. Best Practices

### Recommendations

- **Version Control:** Commit your `skills/` directory to Git if you are using project-level skills. This ensures all team members have access to the same capabilities.
- **Updates:** Regularly check for updates to the skills to get the latest features and fixes.

    ```bash
    npx skills update
    ```

### Performance & Security

- **Review Changes:** Always review the configuration files generated by the `vuepress-plume-config` skill before deploying.
- **Safe Execution:** These skills primarily generate text/code. They do not execute system commands directly without user confirmation in most agent environments.

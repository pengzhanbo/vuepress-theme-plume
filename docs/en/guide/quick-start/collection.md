## Overview

==Collections== are a core concept in the theme for organizing and managing documents.
Each collection points to a specific folder in the source directory,
treating all Markdown files within it as a logical unit for management.

Through flexible collection configuration, you can easily build various content architectures:

- **Blog** - Personal essays and technical sharing
- **Column** - Thematic series articles
- **User Manual** - Product usage documentation
- **Notes** - Study notes and knowledge organization
- **Product Documentation** - Complete project documentation
- **Knowledge Base** - Team knowledge management system
- And more...

## Creating a Collection

A typical VuePress static site has the following file structure:

:::file-tree

- my-site
  - docs \# Source directory
    - .vuepress/
    - …
    - README.md \# Homepage
  - package.json

:::

When you want to add a collection for a **blog**:

:::: steps

- **Create a blog directory**

  :::file-tree
  - docs
    - blog
      - post-1.md
      - post-2.md
      - …
    - …
  :::

- **Add a collection of type `post` in the theme configuration**

  Set the `dir` configuration option to point to the `blog` directory

  ::: code-tabs#config

  @tab .vuepress/config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
  import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      collections: [
        // [!code word:type]
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' } // [!code word:dir]
      ]
    })
  })
  ```

  @tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineThemeConfig({
    collections: [
      // [!code word:type]
      { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' } // [!code word:dir]
    ]
  })
  ```

  :::

  Markdown articles in the `blog` directory are read as article lists in the post collection,
  generating list pages, category pages, tag pages, and other pages.

- **Complete**
::::

Key considerations in this process:

- **`dir` Configuration Option**

  The `dir` option in the collection configuration points to a specific folder in the source directory.
  All Markdown files within this folder will belong to the collection.

- **`type` Configuration Option**

  The `type` option in the collection configuration specifies the collection type.

  The collection type determines which features are provided for documents within that collection. Currently supported types include:

  - `post`: Represents a collection of fragmented articles with no or weak relationships between them.
  - `doc`: Represents a collection of structured articles with strong, structured relationships between them, treated as a whole.

- **`title` Configuration Option**

  The `title` option in the collection configuration specifies the collection name.

  In the theme, `title` is used in the breadcrumb navigation of pages.

## Collection Types

The collection type determines which features are provided for documents within that collection.

### Post Collection

The post collection provides the following feature implementations:

- Article list page - Article pinning, article cover images, article excerpts, etc.
- Article category page - Categories are automatically generated based on the directory structure.
- Article tag page - Tags are generated based on the page's `frontmatter.tags`.
- Article archive page - Archives are generated based on the page's `frontmatter.createTime`.

### Doc Collection

The doc collection provides the following feature implementations:

- **Sidebar Navigation** - Provides clear document structure navigation
- **Auto-generated Table of Contents** - Intelligently generates sidebars based on file structure
- **Multi-level Nesting Support** - Supports complex document hierarchy structures

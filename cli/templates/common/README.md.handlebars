## Deploy to GitHub Pages

The plume theme has been created with GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`. You also need to make the following settings in the GitHub repository:

- [ ] `settings > Actions > General`, Scroll to the bottom of the page, under `Workflow permissions`, check `Read and write permissions`, and click the save button.

- [ ] `settings > Pages`, In `Build and deployment`, select `Deploy from a branch` for `Source`, choose `gh-pages` for `Branch`, and click the save button.
  (The `gh-pages` branch may not exist upon first creation. You can complete the above setup first, push the code to the main branch, wait for `github actions` to finish, and then proceed with the setup.)

- [ ] Modify the `base` option in `docs/.vuepress/config.ts`:
  - If you are planning to deploy to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/`, you can skip this step as `base` defaults to `"/"`.
  - If you are planning to deploy to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/`, meaning your repository URL is `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, set `base` to `"/<REPO>/"`.

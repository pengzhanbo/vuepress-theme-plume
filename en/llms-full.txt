::: info Note
This article translates parts of [Introduction to YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f).
It provides a basic explanation of how to use frontmatter in markdown files.

If you have a good foundation in English reading, to avoid potential content distortion from translation,
it is recommended that you read the original article.

Original article: <https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f>.
:::

## Introduction

YAML is a data serialization language, commonly used for configuration files, such as the
[Open API Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v2.0/yaml/api-with-examples.yaml) or [CI/CD pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/).

::: note Fun Fact! 🤓
According to the [YAML 1.0 Specification Document (2001-05-26)](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-05-26.html),
the acronym "YAML" stood for "Yet Another Markup Language".However,
it was later changed to the recursive acronym "YAML Ain't Markup Language" in the [2002-04-07 specification](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-04-07.html).
:::

As stated in the latest specification, **YAML** is designed to be **human-friendly for handling data**
and achieves "unique cleanliness" by **minimizing the use of structural characters**,
allowing data to be displayed in a natural and meaningful way.

The latest specification also states that YAML *1.2 is officially a superset of JSON*, meaning most JSON documents can be parsed as YAML.

YAML makes it easy to inspect data structures by using indentation-based scoping (similar to Python).

::: note Another Fun Fact! 🤓
DEV.to articles use YAML to define custom variables like title, description, tags, etc.
:::

## Basic Syntax

A YAML document is essentially a **collection of key-value pairs**, where values can be as simple as a string or as complex as a tree.

Here are some notes on YAML syntax:

* **Indentation is used to denote structure**. Tabs are not allowed. The number of spaces doesn't matter
  as long as child nodes are indented more than their parent nodes.
* UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings are permitted.

### Strings

```md
---
# Strings do not require quotes:
title: Introduction to YAML

# But you can still use them:
title-w-quotes: 'Introduction to YAML'

# Multi-line strings start with |
execute: |
  npm ci
  npm build
  npm test
---
```

The above code converts to JSON as:

```json
{
  "title": "Introduction to YAML",
  "title-w-quotes": "Introduction to YAML",
  "execute": "npm ci\nnpm build\nnpm test\n"
}
```

### Numbers

```md
---
# Integer:
age: 29

# Float:
price: 15.99

# Scientific notation:
population: 2.89e+6
---
```

The above code converts to JSON as:

```json
{
  "age": 29,
  "price": 15.99,
  "population": 2890000
}
```

### Booleans

```md
---
# Booleans can be represented in different ways:
published: false
published: False
published: FALSE
---
```

All of the above will convert to JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "published": false
}
```

### Null Values

```md
---
# Null values can be represented by not setting a value:
null-value:

# Or more explicitly:
null-value: null
null-value: NULL
null-value: Null
---
```

All of the above will convert to JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "null-value": null
}
```

### Dates and Timestamps

Dates can be used in ISO format as shown below:

```md
---
date: 2002-12-14
canonical: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z
iso8601: 2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00
spaced: 2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -5
---
```

### Sequences

Sequences allow us to define lists in YAML:

```md
---
# Numbered list using hyphens:
numbers:
  - one
  - two
  - three

# Inline version:
numbers: [ one, two, three ]
---
```

Both sequences above will parse to JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "numbers": [
    "one",
    "two",
    "three"
  ]
}
```

### Nested Values

We can use all the types mentioned above to create objects with nested values, as shown below:

```md
---
# Data for the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.
nineteen-eighty-four:
  author: George Orwell
  published-at: 1949-06-08
  page-count: 328
  description: |
    A Novel, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell.
    It was published in June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book.
---
```

This converts to JSON as:

```json
{
  "nineteen-eighty-four": {
    "author": "George Orwell",
    "published-at": "1949-06-08T00:00:00.000Z",
    "page-count": 328,
    "description": "A Novel, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell.\nIt was published in June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book.\n"
  }
}
```

### Lists of Objects

Combining sequences and nested values, we can create a list of objects.

```md
---
# Let's list books:
- nineteen-eighty-four:
    author: George Orwell
    published-at: 1949-06-08
    page-count: 328
    description: |
      A Novel, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George Orwell.

- the-hobbit:
    author: J. R. R. Tolkien
    published-at: 1937-09-21
    page-count: 310
    description: |
      The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien.
---
```

## Unique Features

Here are some **more complex features** that caught my attention, which also distinguish YAML from JSON.

### Comments

As you may have noticed in my previous examples, YAML allows comments starting with `#`.

```md
---
# This is a very useful comment.
---
```

### Reusability with Anchors

Node anchors are used to **mark a node** for future reference, allowing us to reuse that node.
To mark a node, we use the `&` character; to reference it, we use `*`:

In the following example, we define a list of books and reuse the author data, so we only need to define it once:

```md
---
# Author data:
author: &gOrwell
    name: George
    last-name: Orwell

# Some books:
books:
    - 1984:
        author: *gOrwell
    - animal-farm:
        author: *gOrwell
---
```

When parsed to JSON, the above code will look like this:

```json
{
  "author": {
    "name": "George",
    "last-name": "Orwell"
  },
  "books": [
    {
      "1984": {
        "author": {
          "name": "George",
          "last-name": "Orwell"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "animal-farm": {
        "author": {
          "name": "George",
          "last-name": "Orwell"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explicit Data Types with Tags

As we saw in previous examples, YAML automatically detects the types of our values, but we can also **specify the desired type**.

We specify it by prefixing the value with `!!` followed by the type.

Here are some examples:

```md
---
# The following value should be an integer, regardless:
should-be-int: !!int 3.2

# Parse any value as a string:
should-be-string: !!str 30.25

# I need the next value to be a boolean:
should-be-boolean: !!bool yes
---
```

This converts to JSON as:

```json
{
  "should-be-int": 3,
  "should-be-string": "30.25",
  "should-be-boolean": true
}
```

# ⚠️ 1.0.0-rc.165 Breaking Change Notice: Blog & Notes Features Migrated to "Collections"
:::important
‼️ This update is a BREAKING CHANGE! The blog and notes features have been entirely migrated to a new "Collections" architecture. ‼️
:::

## Design Motivation: Why Introduce "Collections"?

[Jump to Migration Guide 👇👇👇](#migration-guide){.read-more}

### Background & Problem Analysis

The theme initially only supported the **blog** feature, treating all Markdown files under the `docs`
source directory as blog posts. As the version iterated, we added the **notes/knowledge base** feature,
defaulting the `notes` directory as the root for notes and excluding its content from the blog list.

This phased implementation led to an **architectural imbalance**: the blog became a "first-class citizen,"
while the notes feature appeared marginalized. This caused the following issues for users:

* **Path Redundancy**: Note files had to be stored under the `notes/` directory, adding unnecessary directory levels.
* **Complex Links**: When `autoFrontmatter` was not enabled, URLs were forced to include the `/notes/` prefix.
* **Conceptual Confusion**: Users were often confused about the functional difference between "notes" and "docs."
* **Cumbersome Configuration**: Extra adjustments to the `notes.dir` configuration were needed to achieve a standard documentation site structure.

These design flaws were legacy issues from historical iterations, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

### Solution: Unified Content Abstraction

After researching mainstream static site generators (like Hugo, VitePress) and full-stack frameworks
(like Nuxt), we drew inspiration from the `collection` concept in `@nuxt/content`.

We decided to introduce **Collections** as a unified unit for content organization. Whether it's a blog,
notes, documentation, or a knowledge base, they are essentially specific collections of Markdown files, differing only in their presentation.

:::important
Core Insight: Use the "Collection" abstraction to unify the organization of various content types while preserving their respective display characteristics.
:::

Based on content characteristics, we defined two collection types:

* **`post` type**: Suitable for fragmented, loosely related content (e.g., blogs, columns), providing an article list as a navigation entry.
* **`doc` type**: Suitable for structured, strongly related content (e.g., documentation, manuals), providing a sidebar for quick navigation.

This design solves the historical architectural problems and lays the foundation for extending more content types in the future.

## Migration Guide

### Core Concepts

* **Collection**: Specified via `collection.dir`; all Markdown files under this directory belong to the collection.
* **Collection Type**:
  * `post`: Fragmented content, supports article list navigation.
  * `doc`: Structured content, supports sidebar navigation.

### Configuration Migration

Replace the original `blog` and `notes` configurations:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // [!code --:9]
    // Remove old blog and notes configuration
    blog: { /* Blog configuration */ },
    notes: {
      link: '/',
      dir: '/notes/',
      notes: [
        { dir: 'typescript', link: '/typescript/', sidebar: 'auto' }
      ]
    },
    // [!code ++:17]
    // Use collections configuration
    collections: [
      {
        type: 'post', // Replaces original blog functionality
        dir: 'blog', // Points to docs/blog directory
        title: 'Blog' // Collection display name
        // Original blog configuration continues here
        // ...
      },
      {
        type: 'doc', // Replaces original notes functionality
        dir: 'typescript', // Points to docs/typescript directory
        title: 'TypeScript Notes',
        linkPrefix: '/typescript/', // Page link prefix, sidebar judgment basis
        sidebar: 'auto', // Auto-generate sidebar
      },
    ]
  })
})
```

### Directory Structure Adjustment

Migrate files according to the following steps:

**Procedure:**

1. Move subdirectories under the `notes` directory directly to the `docs` root directory.
2. Create a `blog` directory and move original blog posts into it.
3. Remove the now-empty `notes` directory.

:::: flex

### Helper Functions

* `defineCollection`: Helper function for defining a single collection configuration.
* `defineCollections`: Helper function for defining multiple collection configurations.

```ts twoslash
import { defineCollection, defineCollections } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'post',
  dir: 'blog',
  title: 'Blog'
})

export const typescript = defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'typescript',
  title: 'TypeScript Notes',
  sidebar: 'auto'
})

export const collections = defineCollections([
  blog,
  typescript
])
```

# Collections Configuration
## Overview

**Collections** are the core concept in the theme for organizing and managing documents.
Each collection points to a specific folder under the source directory, managing all Markdown files within it as a logical unit.

Through flexible collection configuration, you can easily build various content systems:

* **Blog** - Personal essays and technical shares
* **Column** - Thematic series articles
* **User Manual** - Product usage documentation
* **Notes** - Study notes and knowledge organization
* **Product Documentation** - Complete project documentation
* **Knowledge Base** - Team knowledge management system

Collections are primarily divided into two types to accommodate different content organization needs:

* **`post` type**: Suitable for fragmented content with weak inter-article relationships, such as blogs, columns, etc.
* **`doc` type**: Suitable for structured documentation with closely related content,
  such as user manuals, product documentation, knowledge bases, etc.

::: tip Configuration Location
Collection configuration can be done in either `.vuepress/config.ts` or the standalone `plume.config.ts` file.
:::

## Basic Configuration

Assume your project uses the following directory structure:

::: file-tree title="Project Structure"

* docs
  * **blog**
    * post-1.md
    * post-2.md
  * **typescript**
    * basic
      * intro.md
      * variable.md
    * types.md
      :::

The corresponding collection configuration example is as follows:

::: code-tabs#configs

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Collection Configuration // [!code focus:7]
    collections: [
      // Register post-type collection for blog functionality
      { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' },
      // Register doc-type collection for TypeScript documentation functionality
      { type: 'doc', dir: 'typescript', title: 'TypeScript Notes', sidebar: 'auto' }
    ],
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  // Collection configuration in standalone config file // [!code focus:7]
  collections: [
    { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' },
    { type: 'doc', dir: 'typescript', title: 'TypeScript Notes', sidebar: 'auto' }
  ],
})
```

:::

## Multi-language Configuration

For multi-language projects, you can configure collections separately for each language within the `locales` field:

::: file-tree title="Multi-language Project Structure"

* docs
  * **blog/**
    * post-1.md
    * post-2.md
  * **typescript/**
    * basic
      * intro.md
      * variable.md
    * types.md
  * en
    * **blog/**
      * post-1.md
      * post-2.md
    * **typescript/**
      * basic
        * intro.md
        * variable.md
      * types.md
        :::

::: code-tabs#configs

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    locales: {
      '/': {
        // Chinese collection configuration // [!code focus:4]
        collections: [
          { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: '博客' },
          { type: 'doc', dir: 'typescript', title: 'TypeScript笔记', sidebar: 'auto' }
        ],
      },
      '/en/': {
        // English collection configuration // [!code focus:4]
        collections: [
          { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' },
          { type: 'doc', dir: 'typescript', title: 'TypeScript Note', sidebar: 'auto' }
        ],
      }
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  locales: {
    '/': {
      // Chinese collection configuration // [!code focus:4]
      collections: [
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: '博客' },
        { type: 'doc', dir: 'typescript', title: 'TypeScript笔记', sidebar: 'auto' }
      ],
    },
    '/en/': {
      // English collection configuration // [!code focus:4]
      collections: [
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' },
        { type: 'doc', dir: 'typescript', title: 'TypeScript Note', sidebar: 'auto' }
      ],
    }
  }
})
```

### Doc Collection Specific Configuration

```ts title="Doc Collection Configuration"
interface ThemeDocCollection extends ThemeBaseCollection {
  type: 'doc'
  /**
   * Sidebar configuration
   */
  sidebar?: 'auto' | (string | ThemeSidebarItem)[]
  /**
   * Whether to show sidebar scrollbar
   * @default true
   */
  sidebarScrollbar?: boolean
  /**
   * Sidebar default collapsed state
   * @default false
   */
  sidebarCollapsed?: boolean
}

/* Sidebar item configuration */
interface ThemeSidebarItem {
  text?: string
  link?: string
  icon?: ThemeIcon
  badge?: string | ThemeBadge
  items?: 'auto' | (string | ThemeSidebarItem)[]
  collapsed?: boolean
  prefix?: string
  rel?: string
  target?: string
}

/* Icon type */
type ThemeIcon = string | { svg: string }

/* Badge configuration */
export interface ThemeBadge {
  text?: string
  type?: string
  color?: string
  bgColor?: string
  borderColor?: string
}
```

### Auto Sidebar Generation

When the Doc collection's `sidebar` is set to `'auto'`, the system automatically generates sidebar
navigation based on the directory structure. The sorting rules follow the [Folder Naming Conventions](../guide/quick-start/write.md#folder-naming-conventions).

### Sidebar Icon Configuration

The theme supports two methods for configuring sidebar icons:

* **Define directly in sidebar configuration**:

  ```ts
  sidebar: [
    { text: 'Introduction', link: 'intro', icon: 'mdi:tooltip-text-outline' }
  ]
  ```

* **Define in document frontmatter**:

  ```md
  ---
  title: Theme Introduction
  icon: mdi:tooltip-text-outline
  ---
  ```

Both methods have the same effect, and you can choose which to use based on specific scenarios.

For complete sidebar configuration options and usage tips, please refer to the [Sidebar Configuration Guide](../guide/quick-start/sidebar.md).

::: tip Tips
In markdown content, using the attribute syntax `{data-outline="level"}` / `{outline="level"}`
after a heading allows you to reset the maximum display level for descendant headings under the current heading.

**For example**:

```md /{data-outline="5"}/
## Heading 1 {data-outline="5"} <!-- Only affects descendant headings of the current heading -->

### Level 3 Heading
#### Level 4 Heading
##### Level 5 Heading <!-- Level 3, 4, and 5 headings will appear in the sidebar -->
###### Level 6 Heading <!-- This heading will NOT appear in the sidebar -->

## Heading 2 <!-- Headings at the same level are not affected -->

### Level 3 Heading <!-- By default, only up to level 3 headings are shown -->
#### Level 4 Heading <!-- Level 4 headings are not shown -->
```

Note that the value of `level` should be greater than the level of the current heading; otherwise, it will not take effect.

# Configuration Guide
## Overview

\==vuepress-theme-plume== is a theme developed based on [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/),
and its configuration fully adheres to VuePress's configuration specifications.

**VuePress provides three configuration types:**

* **Site Configuration**: The object directly exported from the configuration file (e.g., `.vuepress/config.ts`)
* **Theme Configuration**: The parameter object passed to the `plumeTheme()` function
* **Page Configuration**: Defined in the page Frontmatter using YAML syntax

## VuePress Configuration File

The base configuration file for VuePress is typically `.vuepress/config.js`,
while TypeScript configuration files are also supported.
Using `.vuepress/config.ts` provides more comprehensive type hints.

VuePress resolves configuration files in the following priority order:

**In the current working directory (cwd):**

* `vuepress.config.ts`
* `vuepress.config.js`
* `vuepress.config.mjs`

**In the source directory (sourceDir):**

* `.vuepress/config.ts`&#x20;
* `.vuepress/config.js`
* `.vuepress/config.mjs`

**Basic Configuration Example:**

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { viteBundler } from '@vuepress/bundler-vite'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  // [!code hl:5]
  // VuePress Base Configuration
  lang: 'zh-CN',
  title: 'Hello, VuePress!',
  description: 'This is my first VuePress site',
  // ...

  // Use Vite as the bundler
  bundler: viteBundler(),

  // Enable the Plume theme
  theme: plumeTheme({ // [!code ++:4]
    // Theme configuration options
    // ...
  }),
})
```

## Theme Configuration File

Typically, we configure the theme in `.vuepress/config.ts`:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Theme configuration
  }),
  // ...
})
```

However, modifying this file causes the VuePress service to restart and perform a full refresh.
For small sites, this process is quick; but for sites with substantial content, each restart requires considerable time.

Frequent configuration file modifications can also easily lead to VuePress ==service crashes=={.caution}
::twemoji:angry-face::, requiring manual service restarts and severely impacting content writing efficiency.

**Solution: Theme Hot-Reload Configuration:**

The theme provides a `plume.config.ts` configuration file. ==Modifications to this file support hot-reload
and do not require restarting the service=={.tip} ::twemoji:confetti-ball::.

You can configure hot-reload supported fields within it, such as `navbar`, `profile`, etc.

::: tip
These fields can still be configured within the `theme` section of the VuePress configuration file,
but the settings from the theme configuration file will ultimately be merged into the main configuration.

To avoid data duplication, please do not configure the same field in both locations.
:::

::: details What is Hot-Reload?

**Hot-Reload** is a development technique that, in the context of VuePress, manifests as:

* Configuration changes take effect immediately without restarting the service; the browser does not refresh the page
* Page modifications take effect immediately; the browser updates content without a full refresh

:::

### Configuration Method

Create the `plume.config.ts` file in the same directory as the VuePress configuration file:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * .vuepress
    * config.ts
    * **plume.config.ts**
      :::

```ts title="plume.config.ts" twoslash
// @filename: ./navbar.ts
export default []
// ---cut---
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import navbar from './navbar'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  // Theme configuration
  profile: {
    name: 'Your name',
  },
  navbar,
})
```

The `defineThemeConfig(config)` function provides full type hints. Except for `plugins`, most configurations can be defined in this file.

::: warning Notes

* The theme configuration file only supports hot-reload for specific fields.
* Avoid reconfiguring fields in the VuePress configuration file that have already been set in the theme configuration file.
  :::

### Custom Configuration File Path

If a non-default path is required, it can be specified in the VuePress configuration:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import path from 'node:path'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Custom configuration file path
    configFile: path.join(__dirname, 'custom/config.ts'), // [!code ++]
  }),
})
```

::: warning Not recommended for beginners; custom paths might cause unexpected issues.
:::

## Page Configuration

Using the YAML Frontmatter at the top of the page, the theme can be configured individually for each page:

```md {1,5} title="article.md"
---
title: Article Title
createTime: 2024/09/08 22:53:34
permalink: /article/xxx/
---
```

The section wrapped by the `---` delimiters at the top of a Markdown file is the Frontmatter, which uses YAML syntax for configuration.

:::tip For an introduction to basic YAML syntax, please refer to [this blog post](/article/ecxnxxd0/)
:::

::: code-tabs#configs

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    locales: {
      // Language code for non-built-in languages
      '/xxx/': {
        // Language configuration
      }
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  locales: {
    // Language code for non-built-in languages
    '/xxx/': {
      // Language configuration

# Markdown Configuration
## Overview

Markdown configuration is used to control the behavior of Markdown.
This configuration aggregates various feature configurations provided by the theme for Markdown enhancements.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // [!code ++:3]
    markdown: {
      // Configure markdown here
    },
  }),
})
```

::: warning
Do not confuse this with VuePress's [markdown](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/config.html#markdown) configuration.

These two are independent. Do not configure the theme's markdown settings
within [VuePress > markdown](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/config.html#markdown), and vice versa.

# Navbar Configuration
## Overview

::: tip Navbar configuration can be set in either `.vuepress/config.ts` or `plume.config.ts`.
:::

The theme automatically generates the simplest navbar configuration by default, including only the **Home** and **Blog List** pages.

You can also configure the navbar yourself to override the default configuration.

The default configuration is as follows:

::: code-tabs#configs

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    navbar: [
      { text: 'Home', link: '/' },
      { text: 'Blog', link: '/blog/' },
      { text: 'Tags', link: '/blog/tags/' },
      { text: 'Archives', link: '/blog/archives/' }
    ]
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  navbar: [
    { text: 'Home', link: '/' },
    { text: 'Blog', link: '/blog/' },
    { text: 'Tags', link: '/blog/tags/' },
    { text: 'Archives', link: '/blog/archives/' }
  ]
})
```

:::

When multi-language configuration is enabled, the default navbar configuration for the corresponding languages will be generated:

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  lang: 'zh-CN',
  locales: {
    '/': { lang: 'zh-CN', title: '博客' }, // Simplified Chinese
    '/en/': { lang: 'en-US', title: 'Blog' }, // English
  },
  theme: plumeTheme({
    locales: {
      '/': {
        navbar: [
          { text: '首页', link: '/' },
          { text: '博客', link: '/blog/' },
          { text: '标签', link: '/blog/tags/' },
          { text: '归档', link: '/blog/archives/' }
        ]
      },
      '/en/': {
        navbar: [
          { text: 'Home', link: '/en/' },
          { text: 'Blog', link: '/en/blog/' },
          { text: 'Tags', link: '/en/blog/tags/' },
          { text: 'Archives', link: '/en/blog/archives/' }
        ]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

As your site content becomes richer, for example, when configuring collections for blog, notes, documentation,
friend links, external links, etc., the default generated navbar configuration may no longer meet your needs.

At this point, you can fully customize the navbar using the `navbar` field, which will directly override the default navbar configuration.

## Configuration

Type: `NavItem[]`

```ts
interface ThemeBadge {
  /* Badge text */
  text?: string
  /* Badge type, built-in: 'info' | 'tip' | 'danger' | 'warning' */
  type?: string
  /* Text color */
  color?: string
  /* Background color */
  bgColor?: string
  /* Border color */
  borderColor?: string
}

type NavItem = string | {
  /**
   * Navbar text
   */
  text: string
  /**
   * Navbar link
   * - Can be an external link
   * - Can be a permalink from frontmatter
   * - Can be a relative path to a markdown file (relative to `sourceDir`), must start with `/`
   */
  link: string
  /**
   * Icon name, or SVG icon
   */
  icon?: string | { svg: string }

  /**
   * Badge, supports custom badge styles
   */
  badge?: string | ThemeBadge
  /**
   * Controls when the element is activated
   */
  activeMatch?: string
  /**
   * Prefix for the current group of page links
   */
  prefix?: string
  /**
   * Nested navbar items, maximum depth is 2
   */
  items?: NavItem[]
}
```

### Nested Configuration Example

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    navbar: [
      { text: 'Home', link: '/', icon: 'material-symbols:home-outline' },
      { text: 'Blog', link: '/blog/', icon: 'material-symbols:article-outline' },
      {
        text: 'Technical Docs',
        icon: 'mdi:idea',
        items: [
          {
            text: 'Vuepress Theme',
            icon: 'icon-park-solid:theme',
            items: [
              {
                text: 'vuepress-theme-plume',
                link: '/vuepress-theme-plume/',
                icon: 'mdi:paper-airplane',
                badge: 'Badge'
              },
            ],
          },
          {
            text: 'Vuepress Plugin',
            icon: 'mingcute:plugin-2-fill',
            badge: { text: 'Badge', type: 'warning' },
            items: [
              {
                text: 'caniuse',
                link: '/vuepress-plugin/caniuse/',
                icon: 'pajamas:feature-flag',
              },
              {
                text: 'auto-frontmatter',
                link: '/vuepress-plugin/auto-frontmatter/',
                icon: 'material-symbols:move-selection-down-rounded',
              },
              {
                text: 'blog-data',
                link: '/vuepress-plugin/blog-data/',
                icon: 'ic:baseline-post-add',
              },
              {
                text: 'notes-data',
                link: '/vuepress-plugin/notes-data/',
                icon: 'material-symbols:note-alt-rounded',
              },
              {
                text: 'shiki',
                link: '/vuepress-plugin/shiki/',
                icon: 'material-symbols-light:code-blocks-outline-rounded',
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  })
})
```

### `activeMatch`

`activeMatch` is used to control when the current link element is activated. Its value is a regex-like string.

**Example:** `activeMatch: '^/(blog|article)/'`

This means that for page links starting with `/blog/` or `/article/`, this link element will be activated.

### Icons

Supports icons from sources configured via [markdown -> icon](../guide/features/icon.md).

* When `markdown.icon.provide` is `iconify`, [iconify](https://iconify.design/) icons are supported
* When `markdown.icon.provide` is `iconfont`, [iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/) icons are supported
* When `markdown.icon.provide` is `fontawesome`, [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are supported

When `markdown.icon.provide` is not `iconify`, you can prefix the icon name with `iconify` to force the
use of [iconify](https://iconify.design/) icons.

```ts
const item = { text: 'Home', link: '/', icon: 'iconify carbon:home' }
```

## Configuration Helper Function

The theme provides the `defineNavbarConfig(config)` function to offer type assistance for the navbar
configuration to theme users. This facilitates separating the `navbar` configuration into an independent configuration file.

```ts title="navbar.ts" twoslash
import { defineNavbarConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineNavbarConfig([
  { text: 'Home', link: '/' },
  { text: 'Blog', link: '/blog/' },
  // ... more
])
```

# Introduction
The theme comes with built-in plugins that extend its numerous functionalities.
You can configure these internal plugins through the `plugins` option.

## Configuration

All plugins used internally by the theme are configured within the `plugins` field.

```js title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: {
      // more options...  // [!code ++]
    }
  }),
})
```

# LLMs txt
## Overview

Add [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) to your site to provide LLM-friendly content.

**Related Plugin**: [@vuepress/plugin-llms](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/ai/llms.html)

## Why llms.txt?

Large Language Models increasingly rely on website information but face a key limitation:
their context window is too small to fully process most websites.
Converting complex HTML pages containing navigation, ads, and JavaScript into LLM-friendly plain text is both difficult and imprecise.

While websites serve both human readers and LLMs, the latter benefit from more concise,
expert-level information collected in one accessible location.
This is particularly important for use cases like development environments where LLMs need quick access to programming documentation and APIs.

Add a `/llms.txt` Markdown file to your website to provide LLM-friendly content.
This file provides brief background information, guidelines, and links to detailed Markdown files.

## Features

The plugin retrieves all Markdown files from your documentation source directory and converts them into LLM-friendly plain text files.

::: file-tree

* .vuepress/dist
  * llms.txt
  * llms-full.txt
  * markdown-examples.html
  * markdown-examples.md
  * …
    :::

Click the links below to view the llms.txt files for this documentation site:

* [llms.txt](/llms.txt){.no-icon}
* [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt){.no-icon}

::: tip
The plugin only generates `llms.txt` files and other LLM-friendly documentation files during
production builds, i.e., when executing the `vuepress build` command, and outputs them to the `.vuepress/dist` directory.

## Configuration

This feature is not enabled by default in the theme. You can enable it through the `llmstxt` configuration option:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Use the theme's built-in default configuration
    // llmstxt: true,

    // Use custom configuration
    llmstxt: {
      locale: '/',
      // ...other configurations
    },

    // Can also configure via `plugins.llmstxt`, but not recommended
    plugins: {
      llmstxt: true
    }
  }),
})
```

[View the complete configuration options in the **Plugin Official Documentation**](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/ai/llms.html#options){.read-more}

## Components

To further enhance interaction between your documentation site and LLMs,
you can add the `<PageContextMenu />` component to your documentation site.

This component is not built-in but is implemented as an additional feature of the theme.
Therefore, you need to manually import it and place it in an appropriate location through [component slots](../../guide/custom/slots.md):

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineAsyncComponent, h } from 'vue'
import { Layout } from 'vuepress-theme-plume/client'
import PageContextMenu from 'vuepress-theme-plume/features/PageContextMenu.vue' // [!code ++]
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

export default defineClientConfig({
  layouts: {
    Layout: h(Layout, null, {
      // Add PageContextMenu to the doc-title-after slot, i.e., to the right of the article title
      'doc-title-after': () => h(PageContextMenu), // [!code ++]
    }),
  },
})
```

You can experience this component's functionality to the right of the current page's title.

::: important
This component relies entirely on the `@vuepress/plugin-llms` plugin and can only be used when you have enabled this plugin's functionality.

Therefore, the functionality provided by this component **is only available in the built production package**.

### Image Dimensions

This feature adds `width` and `height` attributes to image references in markdown files.
It reads the original dimensions of the images to set default image sizes and aspect ratios.
This resolves layout flickering issues that occur between when an image starts loading and when it completes.

This feature is not enabled by default; you need to manually configure `imageSize`:

* If `imageSize` is `true`, the plugin only processes local images, equivalent to the `local` option;
* If `imageSize` is `'local'`, the plugin only processes local images;
* If `imageSize` is `'all'`, the plugin processes both local and remote images.

::: important
**This feature only takes effect during production builds.**

Use the `'all'` option with caution, as it will request remote image resources during production builds,
which can significantly increase build time.
Although the theme optimizes this by loading only **a few KB** of data from each image to analyze dimensions, it will still impact build performance.

# Sidebar Configuration
## Overview

The sidebar is a core navigation area located on the left side of the page in the theme,
serving the important function of guiding users to jump between different pages.

In the VuePress ecosystem, the default theme `@vuepress/theme-default` manages the sidebar through
the `sidebar` configuration option. While retaining this classic configuration method,
this theme also provides a more flexible collection-level sidebar configuration solution.

## Collection-Level Sidebar Configuration

Collections are the core concept for organizing series of documents in the theme.
When a collection type is set to `doc`, you can define a dedicated sidebar navigation within `collection.sidebar`.

The following example demonstrates how to create a collection of type `doc` under the `docs` directory and configure its sidebar:

::: code-tabs#configs

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { defineCollection, plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

// Define document collection configuration // [!code hl:10]
const demo = defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'demo', // Document directory
  title: 'Demo', // Collection name
  sidebar: [ // Sidebar configuration // [!code ++:4]
    { text: 'one item', link: 'one' },
    { text: 'two item', link: 'two' },
  ]
})

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [demo], // Register collection // [!code hl]
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineCollection, defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

// Define collection using independent config file // [!code hl:10]
const demo = defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'demo',
  title: 'Demo',
  sidebar: [
    { text: 'one item', link: 'one' },
    { text: 'two item', link: 'two' },
  ]
})

export default defineThemeConfig({
  collections: [demo], // [!code hl]
})
```

:::

The `defineCollection` utility function provided by the theme simplifies the collection configuration
process. For complete collection configuration options, please refer to the [Collections Configuration Documentation](./collections.md).

## Global Sidebar Configuration

If you prefer to manage the sidebar using the traditional global configuration approach,
you can directly use the `sidebar` option in the theme configuration.
This method is suitable for scenarios that do not require navigation grouping by collections.

::: code-tabs#configs

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Global sidebar configuration // [!code hl:7]
    sidebar: {
      '/config/': [ // Matches /config/ path
        { text: 'Sidebar Configuration', link: 'sidebar-1' },
        { text: 'Sidebar Configuration', link: 'sidebar-2' },
      ]
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  // Define global sidebar in independent config file // [!code hl:7]
  sidebar: {
    '/config/': [
      { text: 'Sidebar Configuration', link: 'sidebar-1' },
      { text: 'Sidebar Configuration', link: 'sidebar-2' },
    ]
  }
})
```

:::

Both configuration methods have their advantages: collection-level configuration is suitable for
modular document structures, while global configuration is convenient for unified navigation management in simple projects.

For complete sidebar configuration options and usage tips, please refer to the [Sidebar Configuration Guide](../guide/quick-start/sidebar.md).

# Theme Configuration
## Overview

Theme configuration is used to customize various features of the theme and control its behavior.
You can configure it in either `.vuepress/config.ts` or `.vuepress/plume.config.ts`.

When a field description includes the following statement, it indicates that the field is not supported for configuration in `.vuepress/plume.config.ts`:

::: warning This field is not supported for configuration in the [Theme Config File `plume.config.js`](./intro.md#theme-config-file).
:::

For fields without the above declaration, you can configure them in either `.vuepress/config.ts`

* **Type:** `false | AutoFrontmatterOptions`
* **Details:**

  Whether to automatically add frontmatter configuration to markdown files.

  ```ts
  interface AutoFrontmatterOptions {
    /**
     * Whether to automatically generate permalink
     *
     * @default true
     * - true: auto generate permalink
     * - false: do not generate permalink
     * - 'filepath': generate permalink based on file path

### cache

* **Type:** `false | 'memory' | 'filesystem'`
* **Default:** `filesystem`
* **Details:**

  Whether to enable compilation cache, or configure the caching method.

  This configuration item addresses the slow startup speed of VuePress.
  It caches the compilation results during the first service start.
  On subsequent starts, it reads the cache directly, skipping compilation to speed up startup.

  * `false`: Disable cache.
  * `'memory'`: Use memory cache. This method provides faster startup speed but increases memory usage
    as the number of project files grows. Suitable for projects with fewer articles.
  * `'filesystem'`: Use filesystem cache. This method provides a relatively fast and stable startup speed,
    more suitable for projects with substantial content.

  ::: warning
  This field is not supported for configuration in the [Theme Config File `plume.config.js`](./intro.md#theme-config-file).

  For the cache to take effect, you should **remove** the `--clean-cache` parameter from the
  `vuepress dev` development server startup script in your `package.json`.

::: tip All the following fields are also basic configuration fields and can be configured at the same level as fields like `locales`.
:::

### home

* **Type:** `false | string`
* **Default:** `/`
* **Details:**
  The path to the home page. It will be used for:
  * The logo link in the navbar;
  * The *Back to Home* link on the 404 page;

### logo

* **Type:** `false | string`
* **Default:** `false`
* **Details:** Logo in the navbar.

### logoDark

* **Type:** `false | string`
* **Default:** `false`

### appearance

* **Type:** `boolean | 'dark' | 'force-dark'`
* **Default:** `true`

* If this option is set to `true`, the default theme will be determined by the user's preferred color scheme.
* If this option is set to `dark`, the theme will be dark by default unless the user manually toggles it.
* If this option is set to `false`, the user will not be able to switch themes.
* If this option is set to `force-dark`, the user will not be able to switch themes, and the theme will be forced to dark.

This option injects an inline script that restores user settings from local storage.
This ensures `[data-theme="dark"]` is applied before the page is rendered to avoid flashing.

### profile

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    profile: {
      avatar: '/avatar.jpg',
      name: 'Zhang San',
      description: 'Here is no silver three hundred two, next door Wang Er never stole',

  Pass in the SVG source code string, with the optional `name` field for configuring [`navbarSocialInclude`](#navbarsocialinclude).

Example:

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    social: [
      // use iconify name
      { icon: 'github', link: 'https://github.com/zhangsan' },
      {
        // use custom icon
        icon: { svg: '<svg>xxxxx</svg>', name: 'xxx' },

### navbar

* **Type:** `NavItem[]`
* **Default:** `[]`
* **Details:** Navbar configuration.

  To configure navbar elements, you can set it to a navbar array, where each element is a `string` or a `NavItem` object.

  * A `NavItem` object should have a `text` field and a `link` field, with an optional `activeMatch` field.
  * A `string` represents a page file path or a page access path.

   * @see https://icon-sets.iconify.design/
   */
  icon: string
  /**
   * Controls when the element is active.
   */
  activeMatch?: string
}
```

* Example 1:

  ```js
  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      navbar: [
        // NavbarItem
        { text: 'Foo', link: '/foo/' },
        // NavbarGroup
        {
          text: 'Group',
          prefix: '/group/',
          items: ['foo/', 'bar/'],
        },
        // String - page file path
        '/bar', // The `.md` extension can be omitted directly.
      ],
    }),
  })
  ```

* Example 2:

  ```js
  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      navbar: [
        // Nested Group - maximum depth is 2
        {

            },
          ],
        },
        // Control when the element is active
        {
          text: 'Group 2',
          items: [
            {
              text: 'Always active',

            },
            {
              text: 'Active on /foo/',
              link: '/not-foo/',
              // This element is active when the current route path starts with /foo/

# Contributing
## Overview

The project repository uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/zh/workspaces) to implement
a [Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), which stores multiple interrelated independent Packages.

* The theme is developed and maintained in the `theme` directory.
* Plugins are developed and maintained in the `plugins` directory.
* Documentation is developed and maintained in the `docs` directory.

In the `plugins` directory:

* `plugin-search`: Provides full-text fuzzy search functionality for the theme.
* `plugin-md-power`: Provides enhanced markdown features.
* `plugin-fonts`: Provides special character font support

## Development Configuration

Development requirements:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) version 20.6.0+
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/zh/) version 9+

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Before starting the development service for the first time, build the source code:

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Main Tools

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code checking and formatting.
* [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) for code checking and formatting.

### Scripts

#### `pnpm build`

The `build` command uses `tsc` to compile the source code into `.js` files in the `lib` directory.
It also copies resources that do not need to be compiled to the corresponding `lib` directory.

After cloning the repository, you need to run this command first to ensure that the project code
can run smoothly, as the compiled output directory is excluded from the repository by `.gitignore`.

#### `pnpm dev`

The `dev` command starts two services locally. One runs the `tsup:watch & copy:watch` for
the `theme` directory, and the other runs the `vuepress` development service for the example `docs` directory.

By default, all plugins under the `plugins` directory do not have a `dev` command.
Therefore, changes to the `plugins` directory may require running the `pnpm build` command to rebuild.
Some changes to the `plugins/**/node` directory require re-running `pnpm dev` to take effect.

#### `pnpm lint`

The `lint` command uses ESLint to check all source files.

When `lint` reports errors, you can manually modify the source code to fix the ESLint errors, or run `pnpm lint:fix` to automatically fix them.

#### `pnpm test`

The `test` command uses Vitest to run all tests.

### IDE Support

It is recommended to use `vs code` for development. This repository is configured with
the recommended `vs code` extensions for developing this theme. When you import this repository,
`vs code` may recommend that you install some extensions.

This document primarily covers common issues and solutions you might encounter while using the theme.

If you encounter any problems, you can first check the content below to see if there are related issues and solutions.

If you don't find what you're looking for, you can start a discussion with us via GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/discussions/new?category=q-a).

If you're certain that there's indeed an issue, please
[Open an issue](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/issues/new?assignees=pengzhanbo\&labels=bug\&projects=\&template=bug-report.zh-CN.yml\&title=%5BBug%5D)
on GitHub. In the issue, describe the specific details of the problem and, if necessary,
try to provide a minimal reproduction package. We will address it as soon as possible.

::: details What should I pay attention to when starting a discussion or raising an issue?
We welcome you to start discussions or ask any questions, regardless of how simple they may seem.
Asking questions actively is good. However, please ensure the following three points:

1. You have already attempted to search the relevant documentation.
2. You provide a detailed description in your discussion.
3. You are not asking questions unrelated to VuePress, nor are you seeking technical support for custom implementations.

   We will not answer questions like "How can I use a specific feature of the theme in isolation in my
   own project?" or "How can I implement a specific feature of the theme in my own project?".
   :::

## How to update the theme?

You can update the theme using the `vp-update` command.

`vp-update` is a CLI tool maintained by the VuePress team. It helps you check for the latest versions of
VuePress-related themes, plugins, etc., within your project and automatically installs the dependencies for you.

Copy and run the following command in your project:

::: npm-to

```sh
npx vp-update
```

:::

## Why don't new features take effect after updating the theme version?

Because VuePress takes a long time to fully compile all `markdown` files in the source directory when
starting the dev server, the theme implements caching for `markdown` compilation to improve startup speed.
After updating the theme and restarting the dev server, if the `markdown` files in the source directory
haven't changed, the compilation is skipped and the cache is used directly. This can cause new features related to markdown not to take effect.

**Simply delete the cache files and restart**:

1. Method 1: Directly delete the `.vuepress/.cache` directory.
2. Method 2: Add the `--clean-cache` parameter when starting the dev server command:

   ```sh
   vuepress dev docs --clean-cache
   ```

## Why don't changes to theme plugin configurations take effect?

This issue commonly occurs when modifying configurations for `plugins.markdownEnhance`,
`plugins.markdownPower`, `plugins.markdownImage`, and `plugins.markdownMath`. The reason is the same as
[Why don't new features take effect after updating the theme version?](#why-dont-new-features-take-effect-after-updating-the-theme-version).
Therefore,

**Simply delete the cache files and restart**:

1. Method 1: Directly delete the `.vuepress/.cache` directory.
2. Method 2: Add the `--clean-cache` parameter when starting the dev server command:

   ```sh
   vuepress dev docs --clean-cache
   ```

## After updating dependencies, restart prompts `import "xxxx" not exist`

Sometimes, after updating the theme and related dependencies, there might be an issue where the package
manager fails to correctly generate the new dependency tree, leading to errors
like "module not found" when importing certain dependencies. At this point, the dependency lock
files (like `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) might be corrupted.

Please directly delete the dependency lock files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, etc.)
and the `node_modules` directory, then reinstall the dependencies.

## How to hide the page footer?

You can hide the footer by adding `footer: false` in the frontmatter of the Markdown file.

```md title="post.md"
---
footer: false
---

content
```

[Configuration Documentation: **frontmatter > Footer**](../config/frontmatter/basic.md#footer){.read-more}

Or you can hide the footer for all pages on the main site by adding `footer: false` in the theme configuration file.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    footer: false, // [!code ++]
  })
})
```

## Build error: `JavaScript heap out of memory`

When executing `npm run docs:build`, you encounter an error similar to:

```sh
<--- Last few GCs --->

[69161:0x7fe63aa00000]   137006 ms: xxxxxx
[69161:0x7fe63aa00000]   139327 ms: xxxxxxxx

<--- JS stacktrace --->
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
----- Native stack trace -----

1: 0x107ce7c84 xxxxxxxxxxxx
...
```

This is due to insufficient Node.js memory.

Modify the Node.js memory limit by adding the following environment variables:

**Method 1: In the current terminal session**:

```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=8192"
npm run docs:build
```

\==Note that this method is only effective for the current terminal session.=={.warning}

**Method 2: In the local environment**:

If you need to keep this environment variable long-term, you can modify the Node.js memory limit in your local environment:

:::: steps

* Install `cross-env` in your project

  ::: npm-to

  ```sh
  npm install -D cross-env
  ```

  :::

* Add `scripts` in `package.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "docs:build-local": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max_old_space_size=8192\" vuepress build docs --clean-cache --clean-temp"
    }
  }
  ```

::::

When building locally, use `npm run docs:build-local` to build the package.

**Method 3: In GitHub Actions**:

Modify the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file and add the following environment variables:

```yaml
# ...
- name: Build VuePress site
  env: # [!code ++:2]
    NODE_OPTIONS: --max_old_space_size=8192
  run: npm run docs:build

# ...
```

# frontmatter
## Auto-generating Frontmatter

This feature automatically generates frontmatter for each Markdown file.

::: details What is Frontmatter?
Frontmatter is a metadata block written in YAML format at the very beginning of a Markdown file.
You can think of it as the "ID card" or "configuration manual" of the Markdown file.
It won't be rendered into the web page content directly, but is used to configure relevant parameters for the file.

Frontmatter is wrapped using three dashes (`---`) and located at the very start of the file:

```md
---
title: Post Title
createTime: 2026/01/15 15:03:10
---

Here is the Markdown content...
```

:::

The current theme supports auto-generated frontmatter including:

* `title`: Article title, generated based on the file name
* `createTime`: Article creation time, generated based on the file creation time
* `permalink`: Article permalink
  * Uses `nanoid` to generate an 8-character random string by default
  * Can be set to `filepath` to generate based on the file path

## Configuration

### Global Configuration

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // autoFrontmatter: true, // Theme built-in configuration
    autoFrontmatter: {
      title: true, // Auto-generate title
      createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
      permalink: true, // Auto-generate permalink
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  // autoFrontmatter: true, // Theme built-in configuration
  autoFrontmatter: {
    title: true, // Auto-generate title
    createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
    permalink: true, // Auto-generate permalink
  }
})
```

:::

### Collection Configuration

You can configure autoFrontmatter separately for each collection.

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      {
        type: 'doc',
        dir: 'guide',
        title: '指南',
        // autoFrontmatter: true, // Theme built-in configuration
        autoFrontmatter: {
          title: true, // Auto-generate title
          createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
          permalink: true, // Auto-generate permalink
        }
      }
    ]
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      type: 'doc',
      dir: 'guide',
      title: '指南',
      // autoFrontmatter: true, // Theme built-in configuration
      autoFrontmatter: {
        title: true, // Auto-generate title
        createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
        permalink: true, // Auto-generate permalink
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

:::

### Custom Processing Logic

Use `transform(data, context, locale)` to configure custom processing logic.
`data` is the frontmatter data, `context` is the file context, and `locale` is the current language path.

* `transform()` can also be an async function, returning a Promise.
* `transform()` is applicable in both global configuration and collection configuration.

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    autoFrontmatter: {
      title: true, // Auto-generate title
      createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
      permalink: true, // Auto-generate permalink
      transform: (data, context, locale) => { // Custom transform
        // context.filePath // File absolute path
        // context.relativePath // File relative path, relative to source directory
        // context.content // Markdown content

        data.foo ??= 'foo'
        return data
      }
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  autoFrontmatter: {
    title: true, // Auto-generate title
    createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
    permalink: true, // Auto-generate permalink
    transform: (data, context, locale) => { // Custom transform
      // context.filePath // File absolute path
      // context.relativePath // File relative path, relative to source directory
      // context.content // Markdown content

      data.foo ??= 'foo'
      return data
    }
  }
})
```

:::

### Interface

```ts
interface AutoFrontmatterContext {
  /**
   * File absolute path
   */
  filepath: string
  /**
   * File relative path
   */
  relativePath: string
  /**
   * File markdown content
   */
  content: string
}

interface AutoFrontmatterOptions {
  /**
   * Whether to auto-generate permalink
   *
   * - `false`: Do not auto-generate permalink
   * - `true`: Auto-generate permalink, using nanoid to generate an 8-digit random string
   * - `filepath`: Generate permalink based on file path
   *
   * @default true
   */
  permalink?: boolean | 'filepath'
  /**
   * Whether to auto-generate createTime
   *
   * Reads the file creation time by default. `createTime` is more precise to the second than VuePress's default `date` time.
   */
  createTime?: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to auto-generate title
   *
   * Reads the file name as the title by default.
   */
  title?: boolean

  /**
   * Custom frontmatter generation function
   *
   * - You should add new fields directly to `data`
   * - If a completely new `data` object is returned, it will overwrite the previous frontmatter
   * @param data Existing frontmatter on the page
   * @param context Context information of the current page
   * @param locale Current language path
   * @returns Returns the processed frontmatter
   */
  transform?: (data: AutoFrontmatterData, context: AutoFrontmatterContext, locale: string) => AutoFrontmatterData | Promise<AutoFrontmatterData>
}
```

## Permalink

The theme uses `nanoid` to generate an 8-character random string as the file's permalink by default.

You can also configure `permalink` as `'filepath'` to generate the permalink based on the file path.
Please note, if your file path contains Chinese characters,
the theme recommends installing `pinyin-pro` in your project to support converting Chinese to pinyin.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i pinyin-pro
```

:::

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    autoFrontmatter: {
      permalink: 'filepath', // [!code hl]
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  autoFrontmatter: {
    permalink: 'filepath', // [!code hl]
  }
})
```

:::

Example:

::: code-tree

```md title="docs/blog/服务.md"
---
title: 服务
permalink: /blog/wu-fu/
---
```

```md title="docs/blog/都城.md"
---
title: 都城
permalink: /blog/dou-cheng/
---
```

:::

You probably noticed that in the example, the permalink for the `都城.md` file is `/blog/dou-cheng/`,
which is incorrect. This is because `pinyin-pro`'s default dictionary cannot accurately identify polyphonic
characters. If you need a more precise conversion result,you can manually install `@pinyin-pro/data`,
and the theme will automatically load this dictionary to improve accuracy.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i @pinyin-pro/data
```

:::

```md title="docs/blog/都城.md"
---
title: 都城
permalink: /blog/du-cheng/
---
```

# ECharts
## Overview

The theme supports embedding [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/index.html) charts within articles.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/markdown/markdown-chart/).

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default in the theme.

You need to install the [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/index.html) library in your project.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm install echarts
```

:::

Then, enable the feature in the `.vuepress/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      echarts: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

::: note
The following documentation is forked from [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/markdown/markdown-chart/echarts.html),
licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem/blob/main/LICENSE).
:::

## Syntax

### JSON Configuration

If you can easily generate data, you can provide ECharts configuration directly through a JSON code block:

````md
::: echarts Title

```json
{
  // ECharts chart configuration goes here
}
```

:::
````

### JavaScript Configuration

If you need to fetch data through scripts, you can use js and javascript code blocks.

The Echarts instance is exposed through the `echarts` variable, and you should assign the Echarts configuration to the `option` variable.
You can also assign `width` and `height` to set the chart dimensions.

````md
::: echarts Title
```js
const option = {
  // ECharts chart configuration goes here
}
```
:::
````

:::tip
You can use top-level `await` and `fetch` to retrieve data from network requests.
:::

Refer to the [ECharts documentation](https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/zh/get-started/) for configuration details.

## Advanced

You can import and use `defineEchartsConfig` in the
[client configuration file](https://vuejs.press/zh/guide/configuration.html##使用脚本) to customize ECharts:

```ts
import { defineEchartsConfig } from '@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart/client'
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

defineEchartsConfig({
  options: {
    // Global ECharts configuration
  },
  setup: async () => {
    // ECharts setup
    // Example: await import("echarts-wordcloud")
  },
})

export default defineClientConfig({
  // ...
})
```

## Flowchart Introduction

### Node Types

Define node shapes.

#### Start & End

* `[Variable]->start: [Text]`

  Used for the first node in the flowchart.
  Default text is `Start`.

* `[Variable]->end: [Text]`

  Used for the last node in the flowchart.
  Default text is `End`.

::: demo markdown title="Start & End"

````md
```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end: End

st->e
```
````

:::

#### Operation

`[Variable]->operation: [Text]`

::: demo markdown title="Operation"

````md
```flow
process=>operation: Operation
e=>end: End

process->e
```
````

:::

#### Input/Output

`[Variable]->inputoutput: [Text]`

:::demo markdown title="Input/Output"

````md
```flow
process=>inputoutput: Input/Output
e=>end: End

process->e
```
````

:::

#### Subroutine

`[Variable]->subroutine: [Text]`

::: demo markdown title="Subroutine"

````md
```flow
process=>subroutine: Subroutine
e=>end: End

process->e
```
````

:::

#### Condition

* `[Variable]->condition: [Text]`

* `[Variable]([yesText])->[Position]`

* `[Variable]([noText])->[Position]`

::: demo markdown title="Condition"

````md
```flow
cond=>condition: Execute operation?
process=>operation: Operation
e=>end: End

cond(yes)->process->e
cond(no)->e
```
````

:::

#### Parallel

Define multiple processes that start simultaneously.

* `[Variable]->parallel: [Text]`
* `[Variable](path1, direction)->[Position]`
* `[Variable](path1, direction)->[Position]`

::: demo markdown title="Parallel"

````md
```flow
para=>parallel: Parallel tasks
process=>operation: Operation
e=>end: End

para(path1, bottom)->process->e
para(path2)->e
```
````

:::

### Connections

Connections are described after node definitions in the flowchart, using `->` to specify links between nodes, e.g., `nodeVar1->nodeVar2->nodeVar3`

Flows can be split:

```md
nodeVar1->nodeVar2
nodeVar2->nodeVar3
```

Connection format is defined as:

`<node variable name>[(<specification1>[, <specification2])]-><node variable name>[[(<specification1>[, <specification2])]-><node variable name>]`

Items in `[]` are optional.

### Directions

The following directions are available and define which direction the connection will leave the node.
If more than one specifier is present, the last one takes precedence.
All nodes have default directions, making this an optional specification. Available values for `<direction>` are:

* `left`
* `right`
* `top`
* `bottom`

### Node-specific Specifiers

Each node variable has optional specifiers, such as direction, and some variables have special specifiers
depending on the node type defined below. Add specifiers after the variable name in `()` separated by `,`,
e.g., `nodeVar (spec1, spec2)`.

* **start**
  **operation**
  **inputoutput**
  **subroutine**

  Optional direction

  `startVar(<direction>)->nextNode`

  `operationVar(<direction>)->nextNode`

  `inputoutputVar(<direction>)->nextNode`

  `subroutineVar(<direction>)->nextNode`

* **condition**

  Must specify `yes` or `no`

  Optional direction

  ```md
  conditionalVar(yes, <direction>)->nextNode1
  conditionalVar(no, <direction>)->nextNode2
  ```

* **parallel**

  Must specify path direction `path1`, `path2`, or `path3`

  Optional direction

  ```md
  parallelVar(path1, <direction>)->nextNode1
  parallelVar(path2, <direction>)->nextNode2
  parallelVar(path3, <direction>)->nextNode3
  ```

### URLs

External links can be added to nodes using the `:>` operator.

`[blank]` specifies opening in a new page

```md
st=>start: Start:>http://www.google.com[blank]
e=>end: End:>http://www.yahoo.com
```

### Recommendations

Symbols that should probably not be used in text: `=>`, `->`, `:>`, `|`, `@>`, and `:$`

To emphasize a specific path in the flowchart, you can additionally define it as follows:

```
st@>op1({"stroke":"Red"})@>cond({"stroke":"Red","stroke-width":6,"arrow-end":"classic-wide-long"})@>c2({"stroke":"Red"})@>op2({"stroke":"Red"})@>e({"stroke":"Red"})
```

## Overview

The theme supports embedding [markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) mind maps within articles.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/markdown/markdown-chart/).

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default in the theme.

You need to install `markmap-lib`, `markmap-toolbar` and `markmap-view` in your project:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i markmap-lib markmap-toolbar markmap-view
```

:::

Then, enable the feature in the `.vuepress/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      markmap: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

# Mermaid
## Overview

The theme supports embedding diagrams generated by [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) within articles.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/markdown/markdown-chart/).

## Configuration

This feature is not enabled by default in the theme.

You need to install the [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) library in your project.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm install mermaid
```

:::

Then, enable the feature in your `.vuepress/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      mermaid: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

::: note
The following documentation is forked from [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/markdown/markdown-chart/mermaid.html)
and is provided under the[MIT](https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem/blob/main/LICENSE) license.
:::

## Syntax

````md
```mermaid

<!-- Place mermaid code here -->

```
````

In addition to using the `mermaid` code block, you can also directly use the following code block types:

* class: `classDiagram`
* c4c: `C4Context`
* er: `erDiagram`
* gantt: `gantt`
* git-graph: `gitGraph`
* journey: `journey`
* mindmap: `mindmap`
* pie: `pie`
* quadrant: `quadrantChart`
* requirement: `requirementDiagram`
* sankey: `sankey-beta`
* sequence: `sequenceDiagram`
* state: `stateDiagram-v2`
* timeline: `timeline`
* xy: `xychart-beta`

You do not need to declare the diagram type again, nor do you need to indent the diagram code.

When the diagram supports setting a title, you can add the title directly after the code block info:

````md
```sequence Diagram Title
<!-- Sequence diagram code
... -->
```
````

Refer to the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/) for configuration details.

## Advanced Usage

You can import and use `defineMermaidConfig` in the
[Client Configuration File](https://vuejs.press/guide/configuration.html#client-configuration-file) to customize Mermaid settings:

```ts
import { defineMermaidConfig } from '@vuepress/plugin-markdown-chart/client'
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

defineMermaidConfig({
  // Set mermaid options here
})

export default defineClientConfig({
  // ...
})
```

# Copy Code
## Overview

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-copy-code](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/features/copy-code.html).

The code copying feature is enabled by default in the theme. It supports one-click copying of code displayed in articles.

By default, the theme adds a copy button to every code block. This button is only displayed on desktop.

When hovering over a code block, a copy button appears in the top-right corner.

## Configuration

Modify the behavior of code copying in the `.vuepress/config.ts` configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // copyCode: false  // Disable code copying
    copyCode: {
      // ...More configurations
    }
  })
})
```

### showInMobile

* **Type:** `boolean`
* **Default:** `false`

Whether to show the copy button on mobile devices.

### ignoreSelector

* **Type:** `string | string[]`
* **Default:** `[]`

CSS selector for elements within code blocks to be ignored during copying.

Example: `['.token.comment']` will ignore nodes with the class `.token.comment` in code blocks (this would ignore comments in prismjs).

### inlineSelector

* **Type:** `string | string[] | boolean`
* **Default:** `false`

Whether to copy inline code content on double-click.

`boolean`: Whether to copy inline code content on double-click.

`string[] | string`: Selector indicating which inline code content should be copyable.

### transform&#x20;

* **Type:** `(preElement: HTMLPreElement) => void`
* **Default:** `null`

A transformer function to modify the code block content within `<pre>` before copying. This option is only effective when using `useCopyCode()`.

## Composition API

The Composition API for this feature can be configured in `.vuepress/client.ts`:

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineClientConfig } from '@vuepress/client'
import { useCopyCode } from '@vuepress/plugin-copy-code/client'

export default defineClientConfig({
  setup() {
    useCopyCode({
      // ...
    })
  },
})
```

### Example

Add copyright information when copying code:

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineClientConfig } from '@vuepress/client'
import { useCopyCode } from '@vuepress/plugin-copy-code/client'

export default defineClientConfig({
  setup() {
    useCopyCode({
      transform: (preElement) => {
        // Insert copyright information
        pre.innerHTML += `\n Copied by vuepress-theme-plume`
      },
    })
  },
})
```

# Feature Support
The theme provides additional features beyond basic code highlighting, enhancing the expressiveness of your code blocks.

## Code Block Title&#x20;

Add `title="xxxx"` after \`\`\` \[lang] to add a title to the current code block.

**Input:**

````md {1}
```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "vuepress-theme-plume"
}
```
````

**Output:**

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "vuepress-theme-plume"
}
```

## Line Numbers

Line numbers are displayed by default in the theme, controlled by `codeHighlighter.line-numbers`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    codeHighlighter: {
      lineNumbers: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

You can also control whether to display line numbers for the current code block using `:line-numbers` / `:no-line-numbers`.
Additionally, you can customize the starting line number by adding `=` after `:line-numbers`,
for example `:line-numbers=2` indicates that line numbers in the code block start from `2`.

**Input:**

````
```ts:line-numbers
// Line numbers enabled
const line2 = 'This is line 2'
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
```

```ts:no-line-numbers
// Line numbers disabled
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
const line4 = 'This is line 4'
```

```ts:line-numbers=2
// Line numbers enabled, starting from 2
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
const line4 = 'This is line 4'
```
````

**Output:**

```ts:line-numbers
// Line numbers enabled
const line2 = 'This is line 2'
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
```

```ts:no-line-numbers
// Line numbers disabled
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
const line4 = 'This is line 4'
```

```ts:line-numbers=2
// Line numbers enabled, starting from 2
const line3 = 'This is line 3'
const line4 = 'This is line 4'
```

## Line Highlighting in Code Blocks

Add `{xxxx}` immediately after `[lang]` to enable line highlighting, where `xxx` represents the line numbers to be highlighted.

**Input:**

````
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output:**

```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to single lines, you can specify multiple single lines, line ranges, or both:

* Line ranges: e.g., `{5-8}`, `{3-10}`, `{10-17}`
* Multiple single lines: e.g., `{4,7,9}`
* Mixed single lines and ranges: e.g., `{4,7-13,16,23-27,40}`

**Input:**

````
```js{1,4,6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: `Highlighted!
      This line isn't highlighted,
      but this and the next 2 are.`,
      motd: 'VitePress is awesome',
      lorem: 'ipsum'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output:**

```js{1,4,6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: `Highlighted!
      This line isn't highlighted,
      but this and the next 2 are.`,
      motd: 'VitePress is awesome',
      lorem: 'ipsum'
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use the `// [!code highlight]` comment to enable line highlighting.

**Input:**

````
```js
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!' // [\!code highlight]
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output:**

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!' // [!code highlight]
    }
  }
}
```

## Focus in Code Blocks

Adding the `// [!code focus]` comment on a specific line will focus it and blur the rest of the code.

Additionally, you can use `// [!code focus:<lines>]` to define the number of lines to focus.

**Input:**

````
```js
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Focused!' // [\!code focus]
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output:**

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      msg: 'Focused!' // [!code focus]
    }
  }
}
```

::: tip Use the valid line comment syntax for the language in different code blocks
For example, in bash code blocks, use `# [!code focus]`

````md
```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [\!code focus]
pnpm install
```
````

```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [!code focus]
pnpm install
```

:::

## Diff in Code Blocks

Adding `// [!code --]` or `// [!code ++]` comments to a line will create a diff for that line while preserving the code block's syntax highlighting.

**Input:**

````
```js
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      error: 'Removed', // [\!code --]
      warning: 'Added' // [\!code ++]
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output:**

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      error: 'Removed', // [!code --]
      warning: 'Added' // [!code ++]
    }
  }
}
```

::: tip Use the valid line comment syntax for the language in different code blocks
For example, in bash code blocks, use `# [!code ++]`

````md
```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [\!code ++]
```
````

```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [!code ++]
```

:::

## Highlight "Errors" and "Warnings"

Adding `// [!code warning]` or `// [!code error]` comments to a line will apply corresponding coloring to that line.

**Input:**

````
```js
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      error: 'Error', // [\!code error]
      warning: 'Warning' // [\!code warning]
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output:**

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      error: 'Error', // [!code error]
      warning: 'Warning' // [!code warning]
    }
  }
}
```

::: tip Use the valid line comment syntax for the language in different code blocks
For example, in bash code blocks, use `# [!code warning]`

````md
```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [\!code warning]
```
````

```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [!code warning]
```

:::

## Word Highlighting in Code Blocks

**Input:**

````
```ts
export function foo() { // [\!code word:Hello]
  const msg = 'Hello World'
  console.log(msg) // prints Hello World
}
```
````

**Output:**

```ts
export function foo() { // [!code word:Hello]
  const msg = 'Hello World'
  console.log(msg) // prints Hello World
}
```

You can also specify the number of occurrences to highlight, for example `[!code word:options:2]`
will highlight only the first two occurrences of `options`.

**Input:**

````
```ts
// [\!code word:options:2]
const options = { foo: 'bar' }
options.foo = 'baz'
console.log(options.foo) // This won't be highlighted
```
````

**Output:**

```ts
// [!code word:options:2]
const options = { foo: 'bar' }
options.foo = 'baz'
console.log(options.foo) // This won't be highlighted
```

:::tip Use the valid line comment syntax for the language in different code blocks
For example, in bash code blocks, use `# [!code word:hello]`

````md
```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [\!code word:hello]
```
````

```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello  # [!code word:hello]
```

:::

## Whitespace in Code Blocks

Render whitespace characters (tabs and spaces) as visible.

Add `:whitespace` after the code block.

渲染每行代码行前的空格：

**输入：**

````
```xml :whitespace
<catalog>
    <book>
        <title>Everyday Italian</title>
    </book>
</catalog>
```
````

**输出：**

```xml :whitespace :no-line-numbers
<catalog>
    <book>
        <title>Everyday Italian</title>
    </book>
</catalog>
```

渲染每行代码行前的 Tab ：

**输入：**

````
```xml :whitespace
<catalog>
	<book>
		<title>Everyday Italian</title>
	</book>
</catalog>
```
````

**输出：**

```xml :whitespace :no-line-numbers
<catalog>
	<book>
		<title>Everyday Italian</title>
	</book>
</catalog>
```

渲染所有的空格：

**输入：**

````
```js :whitespace=all
function foo( ) {
  return 'Hello World'  
}
```
````

**输出：**

```js :whitespace=all :no-line-numbers
function foo( ) {
  return 'Hello World'  
}
```

You can also globally enable the `whitespace` feature in `codeHighlighter`:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    codeHighlighter: {
      whitespace: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

When globally enabled, you can use `:no-whitespace` to disable the `whitespace` feature for a specific code block.

## Collapsed Code Blocks

Sometimes code blocks can be very long, which can be cumbersome when reading other content and
affect the reading experience. In such cases, you can collapse code blocks.

Add `:collapsed-lines` after the code block to collapse it, starting from line 15 by default.

**Input:**

````txt
```css :collapsed-lines
html {
  margin: 0;
  background: black;
  height: 100%;
}

... more code
```
````

**Output:**

```css :collapsed-lines
html {
  margin: 0;
  background: black;
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: inherit;
}

/* the three main rows going down the page */

body > div {
  height: 25%;
}

.thumb {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}

.main {
  display: none;
}

.blowup {
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  object-fit: contain;
  object-position: center;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 2000;
}

.darken {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
```

You can also specify the starting line for collapsing. `:collapsed-lines=10` indicates collapsing starts from the tenth line.

**Input:**

````txt
```css :collapsed-lines=10
html {
  margin: 0;
  background: black;
  height: 100%;
}

... more code
```
````

**Output:**

```css :collapsed-lines=10
html {
  margin: 0;
  background: black;
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: inherit;
}

/* the three main rows going down the page */

body > div {
  height: 25%;
}

.thumb {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}

.main {
  display: none;
}

.blowup {
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  object-fit: contain;
  object-position: center;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 2000;
}

.darken {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
```

You can also globally enable the `collapsed-lines` feature in `codeHighlighter`:

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    codeHighlighter: {
      collapsedLines: true // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

:::

When globally enabled, you can use `:no-collapsed-lines` to disable the `collapsed-lines` feature for a specific code block.

# Code Grouping
## Overview

Code Tabs are a powerful feature in the theme for displaying multiple related code snippets side by side.
By organizing code in tabbed interfaces, you can clearly compare implementation differences across
various tech stacks, configuration approaches, or language versions.

## Basic Syntax

### Multiple Code Block Grouping

Use code tab syntax to organize multiple code blocks within the same tab container:

**Input:**

````md
::: code-tabs
@tab config.js
```js
/**
 * @type {import('vuepress').UserConfig}
 */
const config = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```

@tab config.ts
```ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vuepress'

const config: UserConfig = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: code-tabs
@tab config.js

```js
/**
 * @type {import('vuepress').UserConfig}
 */
const config = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```

@tab config.ts

```ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vuepress'

const config: UserConfig = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```

:::

### Setting Default Active Tab

Specify the default displayed code tab using the `@tab:active` syntax:

**Input:**

````md
::: code-tabs
@tab config.js
```js
/**
 * @type {import('vuepress').UserConfig}
 */
const config = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```

@tab:active config.ts <!-- [!code hl] -->
```ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vuepress'

const config: UserConfig = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: code-tabs
@tab config.js

```js
/**
 * @type {import('vuepress').UserConfig}
 */
const config = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```

@tab:active config.ts

```ts
import type { UserConfig } from 'vuepress'

const config: UserConfig = {
  // ..
}

export default config
```

:::

## Tab Icon Support&#x20;

The theme provides intelligent icon display functionality for code tab labels,
automatically matching relevant technology icons based on tab titles.

### Automatic Icon Recognition

The theme includes built-in icon mappings for mainstream technologies and languages:

**Input:**

````md
::: code-tabs
@tab pnpm

```sh
pnpm i
```

@tab yarn

```sh
yarn
```

@tab npm

```sh
npm install
```

:::
````

**Output:**

::: code-tabs
@tab pnpm

```sh
pnpm i
```

@tab yarn

```sh
yarn
```

@tab npm

```sh
npm install
```

:::

### Supported Icon Categories

The theme automatically adapts icons for the following tech stacks:

* **Runtime Environments**: Node.js, Deno, Bun
* **Package Managers**: pnpm, yarn, npm
* **Frontend Frameworks**: Vue, React, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Next.js, Nuxt
* **Programming Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, C, C++, Java, Python, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Go

::: info Icon Support Feedback
If the technology stack you're using doesn't display icons correctly, please submit an
[issue](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/issues/new) to let us know, and we'll add the relevant icon support as soon as possible.
:::

## Icon Configuration Options

Precisely control icon display behavior through the `markdown.codeTabs` configuration option:

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      codeTabs: {
        icon: true, // Enable icon functionality
      }
    },
  })
})
```

Configuration interface definition:

```ts
export interface CodeTabsOptions {
  icon?: boolean | {
    named?: false | string[]
    extensions?: false | string[]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Examples

**Disable All Icons**:

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      codeTabs: {
        icon: false
      }
    }
  })
})
```

**Display Only Specified Technology Stack Icons**:

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      codeTabs: {
        icon: {
          named: ['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm'], // Only match these technology names
          extensions: false // Disable file extension matching
        }
      }
    }
  })
})
```

**Configuration Notes**:

* `named`: Exact match for technology names (e.g., `pnpm`, `vue`, `react`)
* `extensions`: Match file extensions (e.g., `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`)
* Set to `false` to disable the corresponding matching method
* Empty arrays use default matching rules
* String matching is case-sensitive

## Performance Optimization Notes

::: tip Icon Volume Optimization
You don't need to worry about the impact of icon resources on build size.
Code tab icons are implemented based on the Iconify system, and with the locally installed `@iconify/json` package, the theme automatically:

* Parses and extracts actually used icon data
* Generates optimized local icon resources
* Ensures the same icon is bundled only once

The average size of each colored icon is only 1-2KB. Even with extensive use of different icons, the impact on the final build size is minimal.
:::

Through reasonable configuration and usage, the code tabs feature can significantly improve the readability
of technical documentation and user experience, helping readers more efficiently understand differences between various technical solutions.

# Import Code
## Overview

Importing code allows you to include code from another file in your markdown file and have it highlighted.

It helps you reference code from other files in your articles, avoiding duplicate code writing.

## Syntax

You can use the following syntax to import code blocks from files:

**Input:**

```md
@[code](../snippet/snippet-1.js)
```

**Output:**

@[code](../../../snippet/snippet-1.js)

If you only want to import a specific portion of the file:

```md
<!-- Import only lines 1 to 10 -->
@[code{1-10}](../snippet/snippet-1.js)
```

The code language is inferred from the file extension, but we recommend explicitly specifying it:

```md
<!-- Specify code language -->

## Overview

The theme uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) to implement syntax highlighting in Markdown code blocks.

::: important Important Changes&#x20;

Starting from version ==1.0.0-rc.136==, the theme has migrated the code highlighting plugin from the
internally implemented `@vuepress-plume/plugin-shikiji` to
[@vuepress/plugin-shiki](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/markdown/shiki.html)
provided by the [vuepress ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem).

*(No need to worry about significant changes - I am also one of the main developers of*
*`@vuepress/plugin-shiki`, which implements functionality consistent with the theme's original plugin.)*

Some configuration items require adjustments:

* The `languages` configuration has been changed to the `langs` option. You no longer need to manually
  add the languages you use; the plugin will automatically recognize and load language packages as needed.
* The `themes` configuration has been changed to:
  * When using a single theme configuration, use the `theme` option to configure the code block theme
  * When using dual theme configuration, use the `themes` option to configure the code block themes.

:::

## Languages

[Shiki](https://shiki.style/) supports over 190+ languages.
You can view the complete list of supported languages at [languages](https://shiki.style/languages).

You can use the following syntax to enable highlighting for code written in your chosen language:

````md
``` [lang]
<!-- Your code content -->
```
````

Where `[lang]` represents the programming language you are using.

Example:

````md
// [!code word:js]
``` js
const a = 1
console.log(a)
```
````

```js
const a = 1
console.log(a)
```

## Highlighting Themes

[Shiki](https://shiki.style/) supports over 40+ highlighting themes.

You can find the complete list of supported themes at [Themes](https://shiki.style/themes) and
customize the highlighting theme according to your preference.

Theme Plume's default configuration for code block themes:

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    codeHighlighter: {
      themes: { light: 'vitesse-light', dark: 'vitesse-dark' }, // [!code highlight]
    }
  })
})
```

The default configuration supports using the `vitesse-light`/`vitesse-dark` themes for light/dark modes respectively.

## Additional Features

Thanks to the powerful capabilities of [Shiki](https://shiki.style/), Theme Plume provides additional
[feature support](./features.md) for code blocks, enhancing their expressive power.

Additionally, to facilitate better code demonstrations, Theme Plume provides syntax support for embedding
[CodePen](../repl/codepen.md), [Js Fiddle](../repl/jsFiddle.md), [Code Sandbox](../repl/codeSandbox.md),
and [Replit](../repl/replit.md), allowing you to easily embed code demonstrations.

# Collection
## Overview

\==Collections== are a core concept in the theme for organizing and managing documents.
Each collection points to a specific folder in the source directory,
treating all Markdown files within it as a logical unit for management.

Through flexible collection configuration, you can easily build various content architectures:

* **Blog** - Personal essays and technical sharing
* **Column** - Thematic series articles
* **User Manual** - Product usage documentation
* **Notes** - Study notes and knowledge organization
* **Product Documentation** - Complete project documentation
* **Knowledge Base** - Team knowledge management system
* And more...

## Creating a Collection

A typical VuePress static site has the following file structure:

:::file-tree

* my-site
  * docs # Source directory
    * .vuepress/
    * …
    * README.md # Homepage
  * package.json

:::

When you want to add a collection for a **blog**:

:::: steps

* **Create a blog directory**

  :::file-tree

  * docs
    * blog
      * post-1.md
      * post-2.md
      * …
    * …
      :::

* **Add a collection of type `post` in the theme configuration**

  Set the `dir` configuration option to point to the `blog` directory

  ::: code-tabs#config

  @tab .vuepress/config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
  import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      collections: [
        // [!code word:type]
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' } // [!code word:dir]
      ]
    })
  })
  ```

  @tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineThemeConfig({
    collections: [
      // [!code word:type]
      { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' } // [!code word:dir]
    ]
  })
  ```

  :::

  Markdown articles in the `blog` directory are read as article lists in the post collection,
  generating list pages, category pages, tag pages, and other pages.

* **Complete**
  ::::

Key considerations in this process:

* **`dir` Configuration Option**

  The `dir` option in the collection configuration points to a specific folder in the source directory.
  All Markdown files within this folder will belong to the collection.

* **`type` Configuration Option**

  The `type` option in the collection configuration specifies the collection type.

  The collection type determines which features are provided for documents within that collection. Currently supported types include:

  * `post`: Represents a collection of fragmented articles with no or weak relationships between them.
  * `doc`: Represents a collection of structured articles with strong, structured relationships between them, treated as a whole.

* **`title` Configuration Option**

  The `title` option in the collection configuration specifies the collection name.

  In the theme, `title` is used in the breadcrumb navigation of pages.

## Collection Types

The collection type determines which features are provided for documents within that collection.

### Post Collection

The post collection provides the following feature implementations:

* Article list page - Article pinning, article cover images, article excerpts, etc.
* Article category page - Categories are automatically generated based on the directory structure.
* Article tag page - Tags are generated based on the page's `frontmatter.tags`.
* Article archive page - Archives are generated based on the page's `frontmatter.createTime`.

### Doc Collection

The doc collection provides the following feature implementations:

* **Sidebar Navigation** - Provides clear document structure navigation
* **Auto-generated Table of Contents** - Intelligently generates sidebars based on file structure
* **Multi-level Nesting Support** - Supports complex document hierarchy structures

## Collection Configuration

# Doc Collection
## Overview

**Doc collections** are specifically designed for managing structured documentation,
suitable for scenarios where articles have strong relationships and need to be presented as a cohesive whole. Typical applications include:

* API technical documentation
* Product usage tutorials
* Thematic development guides
* Knowledge system notes

This collection enables quick navigation and content organization between documents through an **intelligent sidebar navigation system**.

::: info The theme supports configuring multiple independent doc collections
:::

## Creating a Doc Collection

Quickly create a documentation collection in three steps:

:::: steps

* **Create a documentation directory**

  ::: file-tree

  * docs
    * ++ guide
      * ++ intro.md
      * ++ install.md
      * ++ …
        :::

* **Configure collection parameters**

  ::: code-tabs#config

  @tab .vuepress/config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
  import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      collections: [ // [!code focus:3]
        { type: 'doc', dir: 'guide', title: 'Guide' }
      ]
    })
  })
  ```

  @tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineThemeConfig({
    collections: [ // [!code focus:3]
      { type: 'doc', dir: 'guide', title: 'Guide' }
    ]
  })
  ```

  :::

* **Configuration Complete**
  ::::

### Multi-language Support

Configure independent documentation collections for different language versions:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * guide
    * intro.md
    * install.md
    * …
  * en
    * guide
      * intro.md
      * install.md
      * …
        :::

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    locales: {
      '/': { // [!code focus:5]
        collections: [
          { type: 'doc', dir: 'guide', title: 'Guide' }
        ]
      },
      '/en/': { // [!code focus:5]
        collections: [
          { type: 'doc', dir: 'guide', title: 'Guide' }
        ]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  locales: {
    '/': { // [!code focus:5]
      collections: [
        { type: 'doc', dir: 'guide', title: 'Guide' }
      ]
    },
    '/en/': { // [!code focus:5]
      collections: [
        { type: 'doc', dir: 'guide', title: 'Guide' }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

:::

## Directory Structure Configuration

The `dir` parameter defines the source file location for documents, supporting both relative and absolute paths:

```ts
dir: 'guide' // Points to docs/guide
dir: '/guide/' // Equivalent syntax
dir: './guide/' // Equivalent syntax
dir: '/team/guide/' // Points to docs/team/guide
```

::: info In multi-language environments, paths are relative to the corresponding language directory
:::

## Auto Frontmatter Generation

::: info Only takes effect after executing `vuepress dev` or `vuepress build`
:::

Supports automatic generation of document metadata with customizable processing logic:

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      {
        type: 'doc',
        dir: 'guide',
        title: 'Guide',
        // [!code hl:10]
        autoFrontmatter: {
          title: true, // Auto-generate title
          createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
          permalink: true, // Auto-generate permanent link
          transform: (data, context, locale) => { // Custom transformation
            data.foo ??= 'foo'
            return data
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      type: 'doc',
      dir: 'guide',
      title: 'Guide',
      // [!code hl:10]
      autoFrontmatter: {
        title: true, // Auto-generate title
        createTime: true, // Auto-generate creation time
        permalink: true, // Auto-generate permanent link
        transform: (data, context, locale) => { // Custom transformation
          data.foo ??= 'foo'
          return data
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

:::

Generation result:

```md title="docs/guide/install.md"
---
title: install
createTime: 2025/03/24 20:15:12
permalink: /guide/a1b2c3d4/
---
```

In the collection, the `meta` option allows you to set the display method of article metadata,
This setting will directly affect the display of metadata on both the **article list page** and the **article content page**:

        wordCount: true, // Whether to display the word count
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

:::

In markdown, configure article metadata through frontmatter:

```md
---
title: Article Title
createTime: 2024/01/01 00:00:00
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

`title` and `createTime` are automatically generated when files are created and support manual modification.

### Available Properties

| Property   | Type       | Default      | Description   |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| title      | `string`   | File name    | Article title |
| createTime | `string`   | Current time | Creation time |
| tags       | `string[]` | `[]`         | Article tags  |

Also supports all fields from [common frontmatter configuration](../../config/frontmatter/basic.md).

## Sidebar Configuration

# Post Collection
## Overview

**Post collections** are used to manage fragmented collections of multiple articles.
The term "fragmented" here refers to scenarios where articles have no strong relationships with
each other or only require flattened presentation. Typical applications include:

* Blog systems
* Thematic columns
* News and information
* Casual notes

This collection provides complete article management features:

* **Article list page** - Supports pinning, cover images, and excerpt display
* **Article category page** - Automatically generates categories based on directory structure
* **Article tag page** - Generates tags based on page `frontmatter.tags`
* **Article archive page** - Generates timeline archives based on `frontmatter.createTime`

Each page reserves areas for displaying personal information, supporting personal profiles or organizational information configuration.

::: info The theme supports configuring multiple post collections
:::

## Creating a Post Collection

A post collection can be created in three simple steps:

:::: steps

* **Create an articles directory**

  ::: file-tree

  * docs
    * ++ blog
      * ++ post-1.md
      * ++ post-2.md
      * ++ …
        :::

* **Configure collection parameters**

  ::: code-tabs#config

  @tab .vuepress/config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
  import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      collections: [ // [!code focus:3]
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' }
      ]
    })
  })
  ```

  @tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

  ```ts twoslash
  import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineThemeConfig({
    collections: [ // [!code focus:3]
      { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' }
    ]
  })
  ```

  :::

* **Complete**

::::

After configuration, the theme automatically scans the `docs/blog` directory and generates the following pages:

* Article list page: `/blog/`
* Article category page: `/blog/categories/`
* Article tag page: `/blog/tags/`
* Article archive page: `/blog/archives/`

When `autoFrontmatter` is enabled, the system automatically generates permanent links for Markdown files:

```md title="docs/blog/post-1.md"
---
title: post-1
createTime: 2025/03/24 20:15:12
permalink: /blog/a1b2c3d4/
---
```

### Multi-language Support

Define post collections for different languages in the theme's multi-language configuration:

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    locales: {
      '/': { // [!code focus:5]
        collections: [
          { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' }
        ]
      },
      '/en/': { // [!code focus:5]
        collections: [
          { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' }
        ]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  locales: {
    '/': { // [!code focus:5]
      collections: [
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' }
      ]
    },
    '/en/': { // [!code focus:5]
      collections: [
        { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog' }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

:::

## Collection Directory Configuration

The `dir` parameter specifies the source file directory for the collection,
supporting both absolute and relative paths (both relative to the source directory):

```ts
dir: 'blog' // Points to docs/blog
dir: '/blog/' // Equivalent syntax
dir: './blog/' // Equivalent syntax
dir: '/team/blog/' // Points to docs/team/blog
```

::: info Under multi-language configuration, paths are relative to the language directory
:::

### File Filtering

Filter Markdown files using `include` and `exclude` configurations with
[picomatch ::quill:search::](https://chat.baidu.com/search?word=picomatch+glob+pattern){.no-icon} pattern matching:

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      {
        type: 'post',
        dir: 'blog',
        title: 'Blog',
        // [!code hl:4]
        include: ['**/*.md'], // Include all .md files
        exclude: ['**/*.snippet.md'] // Exclude snippet files
      }
    ]
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      type: 'post',
      dir: 'blog',
      title: 'Blog',
      // [!code hl:4]
      include: ['**/*.md'], // Include all .md files
      exclude: ['**/*.snippet.md'] // Exclude snippet files
    }
  ]
})
```

:::

## Page Generation Configuration

Pages are generated based on the `dir` configuration by default, with full customization support:

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      {

## Article Cover Configuration

The article list page supports cover image display with various layout and size options.

### Basic Configuration

Define cover image path in frontmatter:

```md{3}
---
title: Article Title
cover: /images/cover.jpg
---
```

**Path Specification**: Only absolute paths or remote URLs are supported. Local images must be placed in the `.vuepress/public` directory:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * .vuepress
    * public
      * images
        * cover.jpg
    * config.ts
  * article.md
    :::

Default display effect:

### Advanced Layout

Adjust cover image position and size:

```md{4-7}
---
title: Article Title
cover: /images/cover.jpg
coverStyle:
  layout: left
  ratio: 16:9
  width: 300
---
```

Display effect:

### Compact Mode

Enable compact layout when no excerpt is present:

```md{8}
---
title: Article Title
cover: /images/cover.jpg
coverStyle:
  layout: left
  ratio: 16:9
  width: 300
  compact: true
---
```

Display effect:

::: warning `compact: true` only takes effect when no excerpt is present
:::

### Top Banner Layout

```md{5}
---
title: Article Title
cover: /images/cover.jpg
coverStyle:
  layout: top
  ratio: 16:9
  width: 300
---
```

Display effect:

### Preset Configuration

For visual consistency, collection-level cover image presets are supported:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      {
        type: 'post',
        dir: 'blog',
        title: 'Blog',
        postCover: {
          layout: 'left',
          ratio: '16:9',
          width: 300,
          compact: true
        }
      }
    ],
  })
})
```

Layout mode description:

```ts
type PostCoverLayout = 'left' | 'right' | 'odd-left' | 'odd-right' | 'top'

interface PostCoverStyle {
  layout?: PostCoverLayout // Layout position
  ratio?: number | `${number}:${number}` // Aspect ratio, default '4:3'
  width?: number // Width (effective for left/right layouts), default 240
  compact?: boolean // Compact mode, default false
}
```

Special layout modes:

* `odd-left` - Odd items left, even items right
* `odd-right` - Odd items right, even items left

`odd-left` layout effect:

::: warning Mobile Adaptation
Automatically switches to `top` layout on narrow-screen devices to ensure display quality

## Article Metadata

## 文章元数据

In the collection, the `meta` option allows you to set the display method of article metadata,
This setting will directly affect the display of metadata on both the **article list page** and the **article content page**:

        createTime: true, // boolean | 'short' | 'long'
        readingTime: true, // Whether to display the reading time estimate
        wordCount: true, // Whether to display the word count
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

:::

In markdown, configure article metadata through frontmatter:

```md
---
title: Article Title
createTime: 2024/01/01 00:00:00
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

`title` and `createTime` are automatically generated when files are created and support manual modification.

## Article Excerpt Configuration

### Auto-extraction

Use `<!-- more -->` marker for excerpt truncation point:

```md
---
title: Title
---

Excerpt content area

<!-- more -->

Remaining body content
```

### Manual Definition

Custom excerpt via excerpt field:

```md
---
title: Title
excerpt: Custom excerpt content
---
```

**Configuration Notes**:

* `excerpt: false` - Disable excerpt (ignore `<!-- more -->`)
* `excerpt: string` - Custom content (ignore `<!-- more -->`)

::: tip Recommended to use \<!-- more --> comment to define excerpts
:::

## Configuring to Site Homepage

The theme provides two ways to set the post collection's article list page as the site homepage to meet different requirements:

* **Method 1: Configure homepage's `pageLayout` property to `posts`**

```md title="docs/README.md"
---
pageLayout: posts
---
```

You can also use the `collection` configuration item to specify which collection's article list page to read.
By default, it reads the first collection's article list page.

`collection` needs to match the `dir` value of the collection configuration.

```md title="docs/README.md"
---
pageLayout: posts
collection: blog
---
```

This configuration directly applies the `posts` layout to the page, displaying the blog article list.

This is the simplest way to change the homepage to a blog page, but it lacks flexibility.

* **Method 2: Configure homepage's `pageLayout` property to `home`, add homepage section type with `type: posts`**

```md title="docs/README.md"
---
pageLayout: home
config:
  - type: posts
    collection: blog
---
```

Using this method, you can not only add article lists to the homepage but also flexibly add different content in other areas of the page.

For example, configure the first screen as `banner`, followed by a blog article list:

```md title="docs/README.md"
---
pageLayout: home
config:
  - type: banner
  - type: posts
---
```

For more custom configurations, please refer to [Custom Homepage](../custom/home.md).

When using either of the above methods to configure the homepage as an article list page,
since the theme still generates the article list page by default, this results in duplicate functional pages.
Therefore, you may need to **disable automatic blog article list page generation** in the collection configuration:

(You can also modify the link addresses of category pages/tag pages/archive pages)

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      { type: 'post', dir: 'blog', title: 'Blog', postList: false }
    ],
  })
})
```

# Component Overrides
## Overview

Layout slots are quite practical, but sometimes you might find them not flexible enough.
The theme also provides the capability to override individual components.

::: warning
Before using this feature, you should first familiarize yourself with this theme's source code
and understand the various built-in components to safely override them.

The theme's component source code is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/tree/main/theme/src/client/components) under the MIT license.
:::

## Usage

The theme registers all non-global components with an
[alias](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/zh/reference/plugin-api.html#alias) prefixed with `@theme`.
For example, the alias for `VPFooter.vue` is `@theme/VPFooter.vue`.

If you want to override the `VPFooter.vue` component, you simply need to override this alias in the configuration file `.vuepress/config.ts`:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import { getDirname, path } from 'vuepress/utils'

const __dirname = getDirname(import.meta.url)

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme(),

  alias: {
    '@theme/VPFooter.vue': path.resolve(
      __dirname,
      './components/MyFooter.vue',
    ),
  },
})
```

   ```css
   /* Light theme */
   .vp-badge.important {
     color: #8e5cd9;
     background-color: rgba(159, 122, 234, 0.14);

     color: #8e5cd9;
     background-color: rgba(159, 122, 234, 0.16);
     border-color: transparent;
   }

   /**

# Card Grid
## Overview

The `<CardGrid>` component is used when multiple cards need to be arranged. Cards are automatically arranged when sufficient space is available.

## Props

:::: field-group
::: field name="cols" type="number | { sm: number, md: number, lg: number }" default="2"

Number of columns for card arrangement.

The component automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen width by default.
Two columns are displayed when space permits, while a single column is shown on smaller screens.

The `cols` prop configures the number of columns. When a `number` is provided,
all screen sizes display `number` columns. When `{ sm: number, md: number, lg: number }` is provided,
the number of columns adjusts automatically based on screen width.

* `sm` : `< 768px`
* `md` : `>= 768px < 960px`
* `lg` : `>= 960px`

It is recommended that the provided `number` does not exceed `3`.

# Masonry Card
## Overview

The Masonry Card is a versatile container component that automatically calculates the height of
each **item** and arranges them in a masonry layout. Any content can be placed within `<CardMasonry>`.

::: details What is an item?

An item represents individual content such as an image, text, video, etc.

* In Markdown syntax, any content occupying its own line (with blank lines before and after) is considered an item.
* In HTML structure, each direct child element of the container is considered an item.

:::

```md
<CardMasonry>

<img src="..." alt="...">

<!-- More content -->

</CardMasonry>
```

## Props

:::: field-group

::: field name="cols" type="number | { sm: number, md: number, lg: number }" optional
Number of columns.

The component automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen width by default.
Three columns are displayed when space permits, while two columns are shown on smaller screens.

The `cols` prop configures the number of columns. When a `number` is provided,
all screen sizes display `number` columns. When `{ sm: number, md: number, lg: number }` is provided,
the number of columns adjusts automatically based on screen width.

* `sm` : `< 640px`
* `md` : `>= 640px < 960px`
* `lg` : `>= 960px`
  :::

::: field name="gap" type="number" optional default="16"
Gap between columns.
:::

::::

## Markdown Syntax Support

In Markdown, the `::: card-masonry` container can be used instead of `<CardMasonry>`.

```md
::: card-masonry cols="3" gap="16" <!-- [!code hl]-->

![](/images/1.png)

<!-- More content -->

::: <!-- [!code hl]-->
```

## Examples

### Image Masonry

Masonry layout is particularly suitable for displaying images. You can directly place `![](image_url)` within `::: card-masonry`.

**Input:**

```md
::: card-masonry

![](image_url)

![](image_url)

### Slots

`<NpmBadgeGroup />` supports passing multiple `<NpmBadge />` components.

The `Props` declared in `<NpmBadgeGroup />` will be injected into the `<NpmBadge />` components.
This approach is used to implement and simplify badge combinations.

### Examples

**Input:**

```md :no-line-numbers
<NpmBadgeGroup
  repo="pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume"
  items="stars,version,dm,source"
/>
```

**Output:**

Use `<slot />` to flexibly define badge combinations:

**Input:**

```md :no-line-numbers
<NpmBadgeGroup repo="pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume">
  <NpmBadge type="stars" />
  <NpmBadge type="version" label="npm" />
  <NpmBadge type="dm" />
  <NpmBadge type="source" />
</NpmBadgeGroup>
```

**Output:**

# Swiper
## Overview

Use the `<Swiper>` component to display image carousels on pages.

## Usage

To use this component, first manually install the `swiper` library:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm install swiper
```

:::

Then, manually import the `Swiper` component:

```md
<!-- Import in markdown -->
<script setup>
import Swiper from 'vuepress-theme-plume/features/Swiper.vue'
</script>

<!-- After importing, you can use it in markdown -->
<Swiper :items="['img_link1', 'img_link2']" />
```

Register as a global component:

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import Swiper from 'vuepress-theme-plume/features/Swiper.vue'
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

export default defineClientConfig({
  enhance({ app }) {
    app.component('Swiper', Swiper)
  },
})
```

Global components can be used in any other markdown file:

```md
<Swiper :items="['img_link1', 'img_link2']" />
```

# Custom Homepage
## Overview

The theme provides a highly flexible approach to customizing the homepage. You can tailor your homepage according to your specific requirements.

The theme defines your homepage through `frontmatter`. Write the `frontmatter` in the `README.md` file located in your `sourceDir`.

```md title="README.md"
---
home: true
config:
  - type: custom
---
```

The theme follows a flow layout approach to render the homepage, dividing it vertically into distinct,
independent sections, with each section applying a different component.

Multiple sections can be defined via the `config` property using an array structure. The `type` field specifies the type of each section.
The theme includes built-in types such as `banner`, `hero`, `text-image`, `image-text`, `features`, `profile`, and `custom`.
You can freely combine these to assemble your custom homepage.
If none of these meet your needs, you can also write custom components to define your homepage.

## Configuration

### home

* Type: `boolean`

Declares whether this page is the homepage.

### config

* Type: `PlumeHomeConfig[]`
* Default: `[]`

Defines the section content of the page based on the order of the array.

```ts
interface PlumeHomeConfigBase {
  /**
   * The type of this section, which determines the component applied.
   */
  type: 'banner' | 'hero' | 'text-image' | 'image-text' | 'features' | 'profile' | 'custom' | string
  /**
   * Whether this section should occupy the full viewport height.
   */
  full?: boolean
  /**
   * The background image for this section.
   * You can define different images for light and dark modes.
   */
  backgroundImage?: string | { light: string, dark: string }
  /**
   * The background attachment style for this section.
   */
  backgroundAttachment?: 'fixed' | 'local'
}
```

## Section Types

### banner

* Type: `PlumeThemeHomeBanner`

A large banner section, suitable for placement at the very top of the homepage.

```ts
interface PlumeThemeHomeBanner extends PlumeHomeConfigBase {
  type: 'banner'
  /**
   * The large background banner image.
   */
  banner?: string
  /**
   * Value range: 0 - 1. Configures the opacity of the mask overlay for the homepage banner image.
   * Supports different values for light and dark modes. When set to 0, the mask is not displayed.
   * This can be used to darken the image if the first-screen banner is too bright.
   */
  bannerMask?: number | { light?: number, dark?: number }

  hero?: {
    name: string
    tagline?: string
    text?: string
    actions?: {
      theme?: 'brand' | 'alt'
      text: string
      link?: string
    }
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```md
---
home: true
config:
  -
    type: banner
    banner: https://api.pengzhanbo.cn/wallpaper/bing
    bannerMask:
      light: 0.1
      dark: 0.3
    hero:
      name: Peng Zhanbo
      tagline: Front End Developer
      text: Even if slow, stop not, even if failed, keep going, but must be able to reach the goal he aims for.
      actions:
        -
          text: My Blog
          link: /blog/
          theme: brand
        -
          text: Github
          link: https://github.com/pengzhanbo
          theme: alt
---
```

**Result:**

   */
  effect?: 'tint-plate' | 'prism' | 'pixel-blast' | 'hyper-speed' | 'liquid-ether'
    | 'dot-grid' | 'iridescence' | 'orb' | 'beams' | 'lightning' | string
  /**
   * Background effect configuration options vary depending on the value of `effect`.
   */
  effectConfig?: any
  /**

   */
  filter?: string
}
```

[See **Background Effects Configuration & Demo** to learn more.](./home-hero-effect.md){.read-more}

/* Default settings, can be overridden in `index.css` */
:root {
  /* home hero name background color. The text color is defined via background clipping,
     allowing gradient backgrounds for more expressive text. */

### posts

Inserts a post collection article list page as a separate section into the homepage.

```ts
interface PlumeThemeHomePosts extends PlumeHomeConfigBase {
  type: 'posts'

}
```

When multiple post collections exist, it reads the article list from the first collection by default.
You can specify which collection's article list to read using the `collection` configuration option.

The value of `collection` should match the `dir` value of the collection.

**Example:**

```md
---
home: true
config:
  -
    type: posts
    collection: blog
---
```

## Custom Section Types

When the built-in section types are insufficient for your needs, you can create custom section types.

Each custom section type is essentially a component.

A simple example is as follows:

::: code-tabs
@tab your-component.vue

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { ThemeHomeConfigBase } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import { VPHomeBox } from 'vuepress-theme-plume/client'

const props = defineProps<ThemeHomeConfigBase & {
  // Component props, properties from frontmatter will be passed to the component
}>()
</script>

<template>
  <VPHomeBox
    :type="type"
    :background-image="backgroundImage"
    :background-attachment="backgroundAttachment"
    :full="full"
  >
    <!-- Customize your content -->
    <div>...</div>
  </VPHomeBox>
</template>
```

:::

Add the component in the `enhance` hook within `.vuepress/client.ts`
::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/client.ts

```ts
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'
import YourComponent from 'your-component.vue'

export default defineClientConfig({
  enhance({ app }) {
    app.component('your-component', YourComponent)
  },
})
```

:::

Then, you can use `your-component` in your `README.md`.

```md
---
home: true
config:
  -
    type: 'your-component'
    # ...

```

# Hero Background Effects
## Overview

For most websites, a **visually stunning** homepage hero section can more easily attract users to stay.
However, achieving **visual appeal** often requires complex technical effort and a touch of creative inspiration.

The theme comes with a series of **visually impressive** background effects built into the **Hero** section of the **homepage**,
which can be easily applied to your site through simple configuration:

```md {6,8-10}
---
pageLayout: home
home: true
config:
 -
    type: hero
    full: true
    effect: tint-plate
    effectConfig:
      key: value
---
```

::: important Only when `type: hero` is set will the theme apply the effect specified in `effect`.
:::

The `effect` property supports the following values:

* [tint-plate](#tint-plate)
* [prism](#prism)
* [pixel-blast](#pixel-blast)
* [hyper-speed](#hyper-speed)
* [liquid-ether](#liquid-ether)
* [dot-grid](#dot-grid)
* [iridescence](#iridescence)
* [orb](#orb)
* [beams](#beams)
* [lightning](#lightning)
* [dark-veil](#dark-veil)

The `effectConfig` should be configured according to the selected `effect`.
In most cases, you don’t need to configure it—the theme will automatically apply preset configurations.

:::important Note
The built-in effects are based on the excellent open-source project [vue-bits](https://vue-bits.dev/),
whose code has been adapted and integrated into the theme under the MIT license.
:::

## Force Dark Mode

Most background effects perform better in **dark mode**,
so it is recommended to enable [dark mode](../../config/theme.md#appearance) for the best experience.

However, for documentation pages, you may prefer **light mode**. Therefore, the theme provides a `forceDark` option in the `hero` section,
which forces the homepage into **dark mode** without affecting the color mode of other pages.

```md {8}
---
pageLayout: home
home: true
config:
 -
    type: hero
    full: true
    forceDark: true
    effect: lightning
---
```

## Dynamic Background Effects

::: important
Some effects may depend on `three`, `gsap`, or `ogl`. You need to manually install the corresponding dependencies based on the effect you choose.

The theme loads these effects **on-demand**, so there is no need to worry about increasing the final bundle size.

### tint-plate

#### Effect Preview

![tint-plate](/images/hero-effects/tint-plate.png)

#### Usage

```md {8}
---
pageLayout: home
home: true
config:
 -
    type: hero
    full: true
    effect: tint-plate
---
```

#### Configuration

`effectConfig` is used to configure RGB values:

* When configured as a single value, it sets the same value for red, green, and blue channels (range: 0–255). Example: `210`.
* When configured as three values, it sets different values for red, green, and blue channels (range: 0–255). Example: `210,210,210`.
* When configured as `TintPlate`, it allows more flexible control over each color value and its corresponding offset.
* It can also be configured as `{ light: TintPlate, dark: TintPlate }` to use different color values in light mode and dark mode.

```ts
interface TintPlate {
  r: { value: number, offset: number }
  g: { value: number, offset: number }
  b: { value: number, offset: number }
}
```

**Example**：

::: code-tabs

@tab Single value

```md {8,9}
---
pageLayout: home
home: true
config:
 -
    type: hero
    full: true
    effect: tint-plate
    effectConfig: 210
---
```

@tab Three values

```md {8,9}
---
pageLayout: home
home: true
config:
 -
    type: hero
    full: true
    effect: tint-plate
    effectConfig: 210,210,210
---
```

@tab TintPlate

```md {8-18}
---
pageLayout: home
home: true
config:
 -
    type: hero
    full: true
    effect: tint-plate
    effectConfig:
      r:
        value: 210
        offset: 0
      g:
        value: 210
        offset: 0
      b:
        value: 210
        offset: 0
---
```

:::

::: info
To help users easily configure visually appealing and personalized backgrounds,
the theme also provides a [Homepage Hero Tint Plate Configuration Tool](../../../tools/home-hero-tint-plate.md).
You can use this tool for visual configuration and generate configuration content that can be directly copied into your own project.

# Custom Styles
## Theme Customization

Custom styles are supported.

Although the theme uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) as the CSS preprocessor,
all colors are defined using `CSS Variables`. Therefore, you can create a CSS file or SCSS file to override them.

First, create a `styles/index.css` file in the `.vuepress` directory. Then, import this file in the [client configuration file](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/configuration.html#client-config-file).

:::code-tabs

@tab .vuepress/client.ts

```ts
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

import './styles/index.css' // [!code ++]

export default defineClientConfig({
  // ...
})
```

@tab .vuepress/styles/index.css

```css
:root {
  --vp-c-brand-1: #5086a1;
}
```

:::

## Style File

Create a file such as `custom.css` in the `.vuepress` directory.

Add additional styles or override default styles here:

```scss
:root {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

You can also use it to override the predefined CSS variables of the default theme.

Below are some predefined variables. For the complete list, please refer to [vars.css](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/blob/main/theme/src/client/styles/vars.css).

```scss
:root {
  /** Theme Colors */
  --vp-c-brand-1: #5086a1;
  --vp-c-brand-2: #6aa1b7;
  --vp-c-brand-3: #8cccd5;
  --vp-c-brand-soft: rgba(131, 208, 218, 0.314);

  /** Background Colors */
  --vp-c-bg: #ffffff;
  --vp-c-bg-alt: #f6f6f7;
  --vp-c-bg-elv: #ffffff;
  --vp-c-bg-soft: #f6f6f7;

  /** Text Colors */
  --vp-c-text-1: rgba(60, 60, 67);
  --vp-c-text-2: rgba(60, 60, 67, 0.78);
  --vp-c-text-3: rgba(60, 60, 67, 0.56);
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --vp-c-brand-1: #8cccd5;
  --vp-c-brand-2: #6aa1b7;
  --vp-c-brand-3: #5086a1;
  --vp-c-brand-soft: rgba(131, 208, 218, 0.314);

  --vp-c-bg: #1b1b1f;
  --vp-c-bg-alt: #161618;
  --vp-c-bg-elv: #202127;
  --vp-c-bg-soft: #202127;

  --vp-c-text-1: rgba(255, 255, 245, 0.86);
  --vp-c-text-2: rgba(235, 235, 245, 0.6);
  --vp-c-text-3: rgba(235, 235, 245, 0.38);
}
```

::: tip
The theme provides a [Theme Color Tool](../../../tools/custom-theme.md) that you can use to create custom colors.

::: tip This document is forked from the [vuepress official doc](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/zh/guide/deployment.html).
:::

The following guides are based on the following assumptions:

* Markdown source files are located in the `docs` directory of your project.
* The default build output directory (`.vuepress/dist`) is used.
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is used as the package manager, although npm or yarn are also supported.
* VuePress is installed as a project dependency and the following script is configured in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:build": "vuepress build docs"
  }
}
```

## GitHub Pages

::: steps

* Set the correct [base](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/config.html#base) option.

  If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/`, you can omit this step as `base` defaults to `"/"`.

  If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/`,
  meaning your repository address is `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, then set `base` to `"/<REPO>/"`.

* Choose your preferred CI tool. Here we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as an example.

  Create a `.github/workflows/docs.yml` file to configure the workflow.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.gitlab.io/`, you can omit this step as `base` defaults to `"/"`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.gitlab.io/<REPO>/`,
   meaning your repository address is `https://gitlab.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`,
   then set `base` to `"/<REPO>/"`.

2. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to configure the [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/) workflow.

# Audio Reader
## Overview

The theme supports embedding audio reading capabilities in documentation.

This feature is powered by [vuepress-plugin-md-power](../../config/plugins/markdown-power.md).

**Audio Reader** is not a music player; it simply embeds an
(@[audioReader](https://sensearch.baidu.com/gettts?lan=en\&spd=3\&source=alading\&text=audio))
button within content that plays an audio clip when clicked.

It is suitable for playing short audio clips, such as **word pronunciation guides**.

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the theme configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      audioReader: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

## Markdown Syntax

The audio embedding markdown syntax is an inline syntax, allowing usage anywhere within markdown.

```md
@[audioReader](src)
```

With configuration options:

```md
@[audioReader type="audio/mpeg" title="title" autoplay start-time="0" end-time="10" volume="0.7"](src)
```

**Parameter Description:**

* `type`: Audio type, formatted as `audio/mpeg`.
  Defaults to inference from the file extension in the audio URL. If the URL lacks an extension, declare manually.
* `title`: Audio title, displayed before the audio icon.
* `autoplay`: Whether to enable autoplay (not recommended).
* `start-time`: Audio playback start time in seconds.
* `end-time`: Audio playback end time in seconds.
* `volume`: Audio playback volume, range from `0 ~ 1`.

## Global Component

The theme provides a global component `<AudioReader />` to support more flexible and comprehensive usage.

### Props

| Field | Type | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| src | `string` | Required, audio source URL |
| type | `string` | Optional, audio format, parsed from `src` by default |
| autoplay | `boolean` | Optional, whether to enable autoplay (not recommended) |
| startTime | `number` | Optional, audio playback start time in seconds |
| endTime | `number` | Optional, audio playback end time in seconds |
| volume | `number` | Optional, audio playback volume, range from `0 ~ 1` |

## Examples

# Bulletin
## Overview

The bulletin is a real-time notification component that enables convenient display of notification messages within the site.

Such as the bulletin in the top-right corner.

## Usage

The theme provides very convenient and flexible methods for using the bulletin.
You can choose the appropriate configuration method based on your requirements.

### Configuration Options

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      // more options...
    }
  })
})
```

```ts
interface BulletinOptions {
  /**
   * Bulletin position
   * @default 'top-right'
   */
  layout?: 'top-left' | 'top-right' | 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right' | 'center'

  /**
   * Whether to display gradient border
   *
   * @default true
   */
  border?: boolean

  /**
   * Pages where the bulletin is displayed
   *
   * - `true` indicates all pages
   * - `false` indicates no display
   * - Pass a function that returns `true` when display is enabled
   */
  enablePage?: boolean | ((page: Page) => boolean)

  /**
   * Bulletin display duration
   *
   * @default 'always'
   *
   * - `'session'`: After closing the bulletin, it won't display again during the current session cycle. It will reappear in new session cycles. Refreshing the page won't make it reappear.
   * - `'always'`: Always display. After closing, refreshing the page will make it reappear.
   * - `'once'`: Display only in the current cycle. After closing, it won't display again. Neither new sessions nor page refreshes will make it reappear.
   */
  lifetime?: 'session' | 'always' | 'once'

  /**
   * Bulletin ID
   *
   * The bulletin display duration uses the `id` as a unique identifier
   */
  id?: string

  /**
   * Bulletin title
   */
  title?: string

  /**
   * Bulletin content
   *
   * Markdown syntax or HTML text can be used.
   * When using markdown, declare `contentType` as `markdown`
   */
  content?: string

  /**
   * Bulletin content type
   *
   * - `markdown` indicates using markdown syntax
   * - `text` indicates using plain text (can be HTML content)
   *
   * @default 'text'
   */
  contentType?: 'markdown' | 'text'

  /**
   * Pass a `markdown` or `html` file path and use the file content as bulletin content
   *
   * - When using `.md` files, markdown syntax will be parsed
   * - When using `.html` files, only include bulletin content. Please avoid using tags like `<html>`, `<body>`, `<script>`, etc.
   */
  contentFile?: string
}
```

## Simple Bulletin

When you only need to configure a simple bulletin with brief content, you can directly use `bulletin.content` to add content.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      layout: 'top-right',
      title: 'Bulletin Title',
      content: 'Bulletin content',
    }
  })
})
```

You can also declare `bulletin.contentType` as `markdown` to use markdown syntax in the `content`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      layout: 'top-right',
      title: 'Bulletin Title',
      contentType: 'markdown', // [!code hl]
      content: `\
**Update Notes**

- Added some features
- Fixed some bugs
`,
    }
  })
})
```

## Long Content Bulletin

When you need to configure a bulletin with lengthy content, writing long content in the configuration file
may appear bloated and difficult to read. In such cases, use `bulletin.contentFile` to specify a content
file path, separating the long content from the configuration file.

`bulletin.contentFile` requires an absolute path to a `markdown` or `html` file.
The theme will use the content of this file as the bulletin content.

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts
import path from 'node:path'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      layout: 'top-right',
      title: 'Bulletin Title',
      contentFile: path.join(__dirname, '_bulletin.md'),
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/\_bulletin.md

```md
**Update Notes**

- Added some features
- Fixed some bugs
```

:::

The theme monitors changes to `bulletin.contentFile`. When the file content changes, the bulletin will be re-rendered.

## Bulletin with Custom Content Interactions

Using `bulletin.content` or `bulletin.contentFile` only allows writing plain text bulletin content and
some interactive content supported by `markdown` syntax. It does not support writing bulletin content with other custom interactions.

For such scenarios, the theme also provides corresponding support.

First, configure the basic content of `bulletin`. You don't need to configure `bulletin.content` or `bulletin.contentFile` at this point.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      layout: 'top-right',
      title: 'Bulletin Title',
    }
  })
})
```

Then, register the global component `BulletinContent` in `.vuepress/client.ts`.
The theme will automatically detect this component and use it as the bulletin content.

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineClientConfig } from '@vuepress/client'
import BulletinContent from './components/BulletinContent.vue'

export default defineClientConfig({
  enhance: ({ app }) => {
    app.component('BulletinContent', BulletinContent)
  }
})
```

Next, write the `BulletinContent.vue` component.

```vue title=".vuepress/components/BulletinContent.vue"
<script setup>
// Write custom bulletin content interactions
</script>

<template>
  <div class="bulletin-content">
    <!-- Custom bulletin content -->
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
/* Custom bulletin content styles */
</style>
```

## Custom Bulletin Styles

You can directly override the bulletin styles via CSS.

Modify the following CSS variables to easily control the bulletin styles.

```css
:root {
  --vp-bulletin-bg-color: var(--vp-c-bg);
  --vp-bulletin-text-color: var(--vp-c-text-1);
  --vp-bulletin-title-color: var(--vp-c-text-1);
  --vp-bulletin-font-size: 16px;
  --vp-bulletin-title-font-size: 18px;
  --vp-bulletin-line-height: 24px;
  --vp-bulletin-border-width: 2px;
  --vp-bulletin-border: conic-gradient(var(--vp-c-important-3), var(--vp-c-danger-3), var(--vp-c-success-3), var(--vp-c-important-3));
  --vp-bulletin-width: 320px;
}
```

Alternatively, override the bulletin styles globally via the `.vp-bulletin` class.

```css
.vp-bulletin {
  /* Bulletin styles */
}
```

## Fully Custom Bulletin

When you don't want to use the theme's built-in bulletin at all, you can completely customize the
bulletin by registering a global `Bulletin` component.

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/client.ts

```ts
import { defineClientConfig } from '@vuepress/client'
import Bulletin from './components/Bulletin.vue'

export default defineClientConfig({
  enhance: ({ app }) => {
    app.component('Bulletin', Bulletin)
  }
})
```

:::

Next, write the `Bulletin.vue` component.

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/components/Bulletin.vue

```vue
<script setup>
// Write custom bulletin
</script>

<template>
  <div class="bulletin">
    <!-- Custom bulletin -->
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
/* Custom bulletin styles */
</style>
```

:::

You need to write the bulletin component from scratch. To facilitate writing the bulletin, the theme
provides the composable API `useBulletinControl()`, which you can use directly in the `Bulletin.vue` component.

```ts
import { useBulletinControl } from 'vuepress-theme-plume/composables'

const {
  bulletin, // Bulletin configuration, read from theme configuration
  showBulletin, // Whether to show the bulletin
  enableBulletin, // Whether the bulletin is enabled on the current page
  close, // Close the bulletin
} = useBulletinControl()
```

## Related Notes

### Bulletin Unique Identifier

The bulletin's unique identifier is configured via `bulletin.id`.

The unique identifier is used to distinguish bulletins and determine the validity period of `bulletin.lifetime` based on this identifier.

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      layout: 'top-right',
      title: 'Bulletin Title',
      id: 'my-bulletin', // [!code hl]
    }
  })
})
```

When you don't explicitly configure `bulletin.id`, the theme generates a hash value based on the `bulletin` object as the unique identifier.

### Bulletin Display Duration

The bulletin display duration is configured via `bulletin.lifetime`.

* `session`: During the current session cycle, if the user doesn't close the bulletin,
  it will continue to display, including into the next session cycle. When the user closes the bulletin,
  it is considered expired and won't display again during the current session cycle, but will reappear in the next session cycle.

* `always`: Even if the user closes the bulletin, it will reappear not only in the next session cycle but also when refreshing the page.

* `once`: Once the bulletin is closed during the current session cycle, it won't display again afterward.

::: details What is a session?
**Session** refers to the period when you visit a site. As long as the browser tab where the site is
located remains open, the site maintains the same session, even if the page is refreshed.
:::

### Bulletin Position

The bulletin position is configured via `bulletin.layout`.

* `top-left`: Top left
* `top-right`: Top right
* `bottom-left`: Bottom left
* `bottom-right`: Bottom right
* `center`: Top center

### Pages Where Bulletin is Displayed

The pages where the bulletin is displayed are configured via `bulletin.enablePage`.

* `true` indicates all pages
* `false` indicates no display
* Pass a function that returns `true` when display is enabled

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    bulletin: {
      layout: 'top-right',
      title: 'Bulletin Title',
      enablePage: (page) => {
        return page.path === '/custom-path/'
      }
    }
  })
})
```

# Changelog
## Overview

The theme supports adding article changelogs to better track the modification history of your articles.

Article changelogs are obtained through git commit history.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-git](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/development/git.html).

::: warning Note
This feature relies on the `git log` command to retrieve commit history for each markdown file,
which can be relatively time-consuming, especially for large projects with extensive commit histories.
Therefore, this feature is not enabled in development environments by default and is only enabled in production environments.

However, you can still enable it in development environments by setting `theme.plugins.git` to `true` for testing purposes.

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: { git: true }
  })
})
```

:::

## Usage

The theme has built-in support for the
[@vuepress/plugin-git](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/development/git.html) plugin, so you can use it without reinstalling.

Enable this feature in the theme configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Disabled by default, only takes effect when plugins.git is true
    // This configuration is invalid in plume.config.ts
    changelog: true,

    plugins: {
      // If you declare it directly as true here, it means the feature is enabled in both development and production environments
      git: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    }
  })
})
```

## Configuration

```ts
interface ChangelogOptions {
  /**
   * Maximum number of change records, defaults to all records
   */
  maxCount?: number
  /**
   * Git repository URL, e.g., https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem
   */
  repoUrl?: string
  /**
   * Commit URL pattern
   *
   * - `:repo` - Git repository URL
   * - `:hash` - Commit hash
   *
   * @default ':repo/commit/:hash'
   */
  commitUrlPattern?: string
  /**
   * Issue URL pattern
   *
   * - `:repo` - Git repository URL
   * - `:issue` - Issue ID
   *
   * @default ':repo/issues/:issue'
   */
  issueUrlPattern?: string
  /**
   * Tag URL pattern
   * Default: ':repo/releases/tag/:tag'
   *
   * - `:repo` - Git repository URL
   * - `:tag` - Tag name
   *
   * @default ':repo/releases/tag/:tag'
   */
  tagUrlPattern?: string
}
```

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    changelog: {
      maxCount: 10,
      repoUrl: 'https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress',
      commitUrlPattern: ':repo/commit/:hash',
      issueUrlPattern: ':repo/issues/:issue',
      tagUrlPattern: ':repo/releases/tag/:tag'
    },

  })
})
```

::: warning Note
Ensure that `changelog.repoUrl` is correctly configured. The default value is [docsRepo](../../config/theme.md#docsrepo).

The theme by default adapts to the URL patterns of git hosting services like `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `Gitee`, and `Bitbucket`.
If you're using a self-hosted service or others, please configure `commitUrlPattern`, `issueUrlPattern`, and `tagUrlPattern` accordingly.
:::

## Notes

This feature requires your project to be under a
[Git repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) so it can collect information from the commit history.

**When building your site, you should ensure all commit records are accessible.**

For example, CI workflows typically add the `--depth 1` parameter when cloning your repository to avoid
fetching all commit history. Therefore, you need to disable this feature so the plugin can work properly in CI.

Services like `GitHub Actions`, `Netlify`, and `Vercel` do not fetch all commit history by default.

In `GitHub Actions`, you can add the `--depth 0` parameter to ensure `GitHub Actions` can correctly fetch all commit records.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # [!code focus:3]
        with: # [!code ++:2]
          fetch-depth: 0
```

For services like `Netlify` and `Vercel`, the processing method is relatively more complex.
In such cases, you can first complete the build in `GitHub Actions` and output the artifacts to
a separate branch, then use that branch for deployment in `Netlify` or `Vercel`.

::: info
For projects created via the theme's `cli` tool, when selecting the deployment method as `GitHub Action`,
the build artifacts are output to the `gh_pages` branch. You can base your `Netlify` or `Vercel` deployment on this branch.

:::

## Giscus

Giscus is a comment system based on GitHub Discussions, easy to set up.

### Prerequisites

::: steps

1. You need to create a public repository and enable Discussions to serve as the location for storing comments.

2. You need to install the [Giscus App](https://github.com/apps/giscus) to grant it permission to access the corresponding repository.

3. After completing the above steps, go to the [Giscus page](https://giscus.app/zh-CN) to get your settings.

   You only need to fill in the repository and Discussion category, then scroll to the "Enable giscus" section
   at the bottom of the page to obtain the four attributes: `data-repo`, `data-repo-id`, `data-category`, and `data-category-id`.

:::

### Configuration

Set `provider: 'Giscus'` and pass `data-repo`, `data-repo-id`, `data-category`, and `data-category-id` as
plugin options to `repo`, `repoId`, `category`, and `categoryId`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    comment: {
      provider: 'Giscus', // "Artalk" | "Giscus" | "Twikoo" | "Waline"
      comment: true,
      repo: 'Your_Repo', // [!code ++]
      repoId: 'Your_RepoId', // [!code ++]
      category: 'Your_Category', // [!code ++]
      categoryId: 'Your_CategoryId', // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

### Themes

By default, Giscus uses `light` or `dark` themes (based on the dark mode state).

If you want to customize themes for light and dark modes, you can set the `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` options
using built-in theme keywords or custom CSS links starting with `https://`.

## Waline

A secure comment system with a backend.

### Installation

If you want to use Waline in the theme, you need to install `@waline/client` first.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i @waline/client
```

:::

### LeanCloud Setup (Database)

::: steps

1. [Login](https://console.leancloud.app/login) or [Register](https://console.leancloud.app/register) for
   `LeanCloud International` and enter the [Console](https://console.leancloud.app/apps)

2. Click [Create Application](https://console.leancloud.app/apps) in the upper left corner and choose a name

::: warning Domestic version requires ICP filing

If you are using the LeanCloud domestic version ([leancloud.cn](https://leancloud.cn)), we recommend
switching to the international version ([leancloud.app](https://leancloud.app)).
Otherwise, you need to bind an **already ICP-filed** domain to the application, purchase an independent IP, and complete the ICP filing process:

* Log in to the domestic version and enter the application you need to use
* Select `Settings` > `Domain Binding` > `API Access Domain` > `Bind New Domain` > Enter domain > `OK`.
* Follow the instructions on the page to complete the CNAME resolution in DNS as required.
* Purchase an independent IP and submit a work order to complete the ICP filing. (The current price for an independent IP is ¥50/month)

4. Click `Settings` at the top - `Environment Variables` to enter the environment variable configuration page,
   and configure the three environment variables `LEAN_ID`, `LEAN_KEY`, and `LEAN_MASTER_KEY`.
   Their values correspond to the `APP ID`, `APP KEY`, and `Master Key` obtained from LeanCloud in the previous step, respectively.

   ![Set Environment Variables](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-5.png)

   ::: note

   If you are using the LeanCloud domestic version, please additionally configure the `LEAN_SERVER`
   environment variable with the value of your bound domain.

   :::

5. After configuring the environment variables, click `Deployments` at the top,
   then click the `Redeploy` button on the right side of the latest deployment to redeploy.
   This step is to make the environment variables you just set take effect.

3. Add a new `CNAME` record at your domain DNS provider.

   | Type  | Name    | Value                |
   | ----- | ------- | -------------------- |
   | CNAME | example | cname.vercel-dns.com |

4. Wait for it to take effect. You can now access it via your own domain :tada:

   * Comment system: example.your-domain.com
   * Comment management: example.your-domain.com/ui

   ![success](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/images/comment/vercel-9.png)

:::

### Client

#### Using the Plugin

Set `provider: "Waline"` in the plugin options, and set the server address `serverURL` to the value obtained in the previous step.

At this point, place the `<CommentService>` component in a suitable location on your website
(usually at the bottom of the page) to use the Waline comment functionality.

::: tip

You can also pass other options supported by Waline (except `el`). For details, see [Waline Configuration](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/blog/comment/waline/config.html).

:::

# Content Search
The theme provides two approaches for content search:

* Local Content Search
* Algolia DocSearch

Note: Do not configure both approaches simultaneously. When both are configured, only Local Content Search will take effect.

## Local Content Search

Local Content Search is powered by the
[@vuepress-plume/plugin-search](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/tree/main/plugins/plugin-search) plugin.

This plugin uses [minisearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) for content searching.

### Enabling

The theme enables Local Content Search by default. You can also customize its configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    search: { // [!code ++:4]
      provider: 'local',
      // more options
    }
  })
})
```

This plugin generates search indexes locally based on your pages, then loads the search index files when users visit your site.
In other words, this is a lightweight built-in search capability that doesn't make any external requests.

However, when your site contains a large number of pages, the search index file can become very large and may slow down your page loading speed.
In such cases, we recommend using a more robust solution - [Algolia DocSearch](#algolia-docsearch).

## Algolia DocSearch

Site content search powered by [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

### Enabling

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    search: { // [!code ++:4]
      provider: 'algolia',
      // more options
    }
  })
})
```

### Obtaining Search Index

You need to [submit your website URL](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/) to join the DocSearch program.
When your index is successfully created, the DocSearch team will send `apiKey` and `indexName` to your email.
You can then configure the plugin to enable DocSearch in VuePress.

Alternatively, you can [run your own crawler](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/run-your-own/) to create the index,
then use your own `appId`, `apiKey`, and `indexName` to configure the plugin.

Here's a crawler configuration example used by this theme. You can visit [Algolia Crawler](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/crawlers/)
and modify it according to your needs:

```ts
new Crawler({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // [!code highlight]
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // [!code highlight]
  rateLimit: 8,
  startUrls: [
    // These are the initial URLs where Algolia starts crawling your site
    // If your site is divided into several independent sections, you may need to set multiple entry links here
    'https://YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/', // [!code highlight]
  ],
  renderJavaScript: false,
  sitemaps: [
    // The theme generates sitemap by default; replace with your domain link here
    'https://YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/sitemap.xml', // [!code highlight]
  ],
  ignoreCanonicalTo: true,
  discoveryPatterns: [
    // This defines the scope of URLs that Algolia will crawl
    'https://YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/**', // [!code highlight]
  ],
  // Crawler execution schedule; set according to your documentation update frequency
  schedule: 'at 02:00 every 1 day',
  actions: [
    // You can have multiple actions, especially when deploying multiple documentations under one domain
    {
      // Name your index appropriately
      indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME', // [!code highlight]
      // Paths where the index takes effect
      pathsToMatch: ['https://YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/**'], // [!code highlight]
      recordExtractor: ({ helpers }) => {
        // Options for vuepress-theme-plume
        return helpers.docsearch({
          recordProps: { // [!code highlight]

# Contributors
## Overview

The theme supports adding contributor information to articles to better track your article contributors.

Article contributors are obtained through git commit history.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-git](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/development/git.html).

::: warning Note
This feature relies on the `git log` command to retrieve commit history for each markdown file,
which can be relatively time-consuming, especially for large projects with extensive commit histories.
Therefore, this feature is not enabled in development environments by default and is only enabled in production environments.

However, you can still enable it in development environments by setting `theme.plugins.git` to `true` for testing purposes.

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: { git: true }
  })
})
```

:::

## Usage

The theme has built-in support for the
[@vuepress/plugin-git](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/development/git.html) plugin, so you can use it without reinstalling.

Enable this feature in the theme configuration file:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Enabled by default, only takes effect when plugins.git is true
    // This configuration is invalid in plume.config.ts
    contributors: true,

    plugins: {
      // If you declare it directly as true here, it means the feature is enabled in both development and production environments
      git: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    }
  })
})
```

## Configuration

### mode

* Type: `'inline' | 'block'`
* Default: `'inline'`
* Description:

  * `inline`: Display contributor information at the bottom of the article page,
    alongside the last updated time. In this mode, only contributor names are displayed.

    ![contributors inline](/images/contributors-inline.png)

  * `block`: Insert contributor information at the end of the article content. This mode includes contributor names, links, and avatars.
    (As shown at the end of the current page's content)

    In `block` mode, avatars are displayed by default for all contributors,
    even if you haven't provided an avatar URL.
    The plugin will generate avatar URLs from `https://gravatar.com/` based on email addresses or usernames.

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    contributors: {
      mode: 'block',
    },
  })
})
```

### info

* Type: `ContributorInfo[]`

  ```ts
  interface ContributorInfo {
    /**
     * Contributor's username on Git hosting service
     */
    username: string
    /**
     * Name displayed for the contributor on the page, defaults to `username`
     */
    name?: string
    /**
     * Contributor alias. Since the username saved in local git configuration might not match the hosting service username,
     * aliases can be used to map to the actual username
     */
    alias?: string[] | string
    /**
     * Contributor avatar URL
     * If the git hosting service is `GitHub`, this can be omitted as the plugin will auto-fill it
     */
    avatar?: string
    /**
     * Contributor profile URL
     * If the git hosting service is `GitHub`, this can be omitted as the plugin will auto-fill it
     */
    url?: string
  }
  ```

* Description:

  List of contributor information.

  The username and email configured in the user's local git service might not match the user information
  on git hosting services (like GitHub, GitLab, Gitee). You can pre-configure contributor information here.

  (For non-GitHub git hosting services such as GitLab and Gitee, since avatars and user URLs cannot be
  directly obtained from usernames, please supplement and complete user information here.)

## frontmatter

### contributors

* Type: `boolean | string[]`

* Description:

  Whether to display contributor information.

  If your article comes from a third party and git commits cannot fully list all authors, you can supplement contributors here.

## Notes

This feature requires your project to be under a
[Git repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) so it can collect information from the commit history.

**When building your site, you should ensure all commit records are accessible.**

For example, CI workflows typically add the `--depth 1` parameter when cloning your repository to avoid
fetching all commit history. Therefore, you need to disable this feature so the plugin can work properly in CI.

Services like `GitHub Actions`, `Netlify`, and `Vercel` do not fetch all commit history by default.

In `GitHub Actions`, you can add the `--depth 0` parameter to ensure `GitHub Actions` can correctly fetch all commit records.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # [!code focus:3]
        with: # [!code ++:2]
          fetch-depth: 0
```

For services like `Netlify` and `Vercel`, the processing method is relatively more complex.
In such cases, you can first complete the build in `GitHub Actions` and output the artifacts to a
separate branch, then use that branch for deployment in `Netlify` or `Vercel`.

::: info
For projects created via the theme's `cli` tool, when selecting the deployment method as `GitHub Action`,
the build artifacts are output to the `gh_pages` branch. You can base your `Netlify` or `Vercel` deployment on this branch.

# Article Copyright
## Overview

The theme supports adding **copyright** declarations for articles.

Articles typically originate from original works, reposts, translations, etc.
Adding copyright information for different sources helps better protect intellectual property rights and avoid copyright disputes.

### Creative Commons

The theme natively supports copyright declarations using [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses, including:

* [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

* [Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

* [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

* [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC-BY-NC-4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)

* [Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC-BY-ND-4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

* [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)


You can select different licenses based on your requirements, or define custom licenses.

### Copyright Information

Copyright information includes:

* Copyright owner, copyright owner link
* Copyright license, copyright license link
* Original work link

This information is displayed at the bottom of articles.

::: tip It is recommended to enable the [Contributors](./contributors.md) feature when using this
functionality. For original articles, the theme automatically uses the first contributor as the
copyright owner. You can also manually specify the copyright owner in the article frontmatter.
:::

## Global Configuration

You can declare the `CC-BY-4.0` license for all articles on your site with the following configuration:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    copyright: 'CC-BY-4.0' // [!code hl]
  })
})
```

You can declare a custom copyright license for all articles on your site with the following configuration:

```ts :no-line-numbers title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    copyright: { // [!code hl:6]
      license: {
        name: 'MIT', // License name
        url: 'https://your-license-url' // License URL
      },
      author: {
        name: 'Your Name', // Copyright owner name
        url: 'https://your-author-url' // Copyright owner URL
      },
      creation: 'reprint' // Creation type
    }
  })
})
```

**Configuration Type:**

```ts
export type CopyrightLicense
  = | 'CC-BY-4.0'
    | 'CC-BY-SA-4.0'
    | 'CC-BY-NC-4.0'
    | 'CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0'
    | 'CC-BY-ND-4.0'
    | 'CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0'
    | 'CC0'
    | string

/**
 * - When set to `true`, defaults to `CC-BY-4.0`
 * - When set to `false`, copyright is hidden, but can be overridden in article frontmatter.copyright
 */
type CopyrightOptions = boolean | string | CopyrightLicense | {
  /**
   * Copyright license
   */
  license?: CopyrightLicense | {
    name: CopyrightLicense | string
    url: string
  }
  /**
   * Copyright owner. If not configured, defaults to obtaining from git commit records
   */
  author?: {
    name: string
    url?: string
  }
  /**
   * Creation type: original, translation, or repost
   * @default 'original'
   */
  creation?: 'original' | 'translate' | 'reprint'
}
```

::: warning Global configuration only applies to original articles. For non-original articles,
you should configure copyright information in the article frontmatter.
:::

## Article Frontmatter Configuration

You can configure copyright information for individual articles in the article frontmatter to override global configuration:

```md
---
title: My Article
copyright: CC-BY-4.0
---
```

**Configuration Type:**

```ts
/**
 * When set to `false`, copyright is hidden
 * When set to `true`, defaults to the global copyright configuration
 */
export type CopyrightFrontmatter = boolean | string | CopyrightLicense | {
  /**
   * Copyright license
   */
  license?: CopyrightLicense | { name: string, url: string }

  /**
   * Copyright owner
   * - For original articles, defaults to the first contributor
   * - For non-original articles, the copyright owner must be declared
   */
  author?: string | { name: string, url?: string }

  /**
   * Article creation type: original, translation, or repost
   * @default 'original'
   */
  creation?: 'original' | 'translate' | 'reprint'

  /**
   * Original article URL. Must be declared for non-original works
   * @default ''
   */
  source?: string

# Encryption
## Encryption

In this topic, various flexible encryption methods such as **full-site encryption** and **partial encryption** are supported.

::: warning Note
Due to the limitations of `vuepress` as a static site, **encryption** only makes the content *appear* invisible.
During compilation, the content is not pre-rendered into the `html`,
but it can still be retrieved from the site's source files.
Therefore, the **encryption** feature should not be considered as completely secure or reliable.

Avoid using the **encryption feature** for content that requires **strict confidentiality**.
:::

**Unlocked articles are only visible during the current session.**

## Enabling Encryption

Add the `encrypt` option in the theme configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    encrypt: {
      // more options...
    }
  })
})
```

## Full-Site Encryption

In some cases, you may need to encrypt the entire site.
You can configure full-site encryption using the `encrypt.global` option and set one or more passwords with `encrypt.admin`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    encrypt: {
      global: true,
      admin: ['123456'],
    }
  })
})
```

## Partial Encryption

In most cases, you may only need to encrypt a specific article, directory, etc.
You can configure partial encryption using the `encrypt.rules` option.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    encrypt: {
      rules: {
        // Can be the relative path of an MD file to encrypt that file
        '前端/基础.md': '123456',
        // Can be a directory path to encrypt all articles under that directory
        '/notes/vuepress-theme-plume/': '123456',
        // Can be a request path to encrypt all articles under that path
        '/vuepress-theme-plume/': '123456',
        // Can be a specific page's request path to encrypt that page
        '/article/f8dnci3/': '123456',
        // If prefixed with `^`, pages matching the regex will also be encrypted
        '^/(a|b)/': '123456',
      }
    }
  })
})
```

The **key** in `encrypt.rules` serves as the matching rule,
and the **value** is the corresponding password (or multiple passwords) for that rule.

:::tip Notes

* Passwords must be plain strings.
* If encrypting an entire directory, unlocking applies to the entire directory, not individual articles within it.
* `encrypt.admin` can also be used to unlock **partially encrypted** pages.
* After unlocking with `encrypt.admin`, the user is considered an admin, and all other locked pages are unlocked by default.
  :::

### Frontmatter

In the `Frontmatter` of a Markdown file, you can set the article's password using the `password` field.

```md
---
title: Encrypted Article
password: 123456
---
```

You can also add the `passwordHint` option to provide a password hint.

```md
---
title: Encrypted Article
password: 123456
passwordHint: The password is 123456
---
```

## Example

Click to visit [Encrypted Article, Password: 123456](/article/enx7c9s/)

## Partial Content Encryption

### Configuration

Partial content encryption is implemented through the `::: encrypt` container. You need to configure the `markdown.encrypt` option:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      encrypt: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

You can also set a unified default password for the `::: encrypt` container:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      encrypt: {
        password: 123456, // [!code ++]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

### Usage

Use the `::: encrypt` container to wrap the content that needs to be encrypted.
You can add `password` / `pwd` attribute to the container to set the password for that container.
If no password is set, the default password will be used.

You can also add a `hint` attribute to set a password hint.

```md /password="123456"/
::: encrypt password="123456" hint="The password is 6 consecutive digits"
This is encrypted content
:::
```

::: info Only one password is effective; multiple passwords are not supported simultaneously.
:::

### Example

**Input:**

```md
::: encrypt password="123456"
This is encrypted content
:::
```

**Output:**

**Input:**

```md
::: encrypt password="654321" hint="The password is 6 consecutive digits"
This is encrypted content 2
:::
```

**Output:**

::: warning Usage Limitations
**For encrypted content, you can use:**

* All standard markdown syntax
* Most extended syntax provided by the theme, except:
  * `@[demo]()` code examples imported from directories
  * `@[code]()` code snippets imported from directories
  * `@[code-tree]()` code trees imported from directories
* Global Vue components provided by the theme
* User-defined global Vue components
* Encrypted content cannot contain executable scripts; for special interactions, please implement through components.

**Network Environment Requirements:**
Partial content encryption is implemented using [Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto),
therefore, it will not work properly in **non-HTTPS environments**.
:::

::: details If you are a technical developer, you may need to know

The original markdown content is first rendered into HTML content, then encrypted; transmitted to the client, then decrypted and rendered.
The decrypted content is wrapped as a dynamic Vue component, with HTML passed as the template to the dynamic component.
This involves runtime template compilation. As a result, if partial content encryption is enabled,
Vue needs to be switched to the `esm-bundler` version to support runtime compilation,
which has slightly worse performance and larger size compared to the default `runtime-only` version.
:::

## Related Configurations

The following configurations can be used in [multilingual settings](../../config/locales.md).

### encryptGlobalText

* **Type**: `string`
* **Default**: `'Only password can access this site'`
* **Description**:

  The prompt message for full-site encryption. Supports HTML. Useful if you want to provide contact information for visitors to obtain the password.

### encryptPageText

# Icons
## Overview

The theme supports icons from the following sources:

* [iconify](https://iconify.design/) - Supported by default
* [iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/) - Optional
* [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Optional

Icons are used in the same way across the following theme features:

* [Navbar Icons](../../config/navbar.md#configuration)
* [Sidebar Icons](../../guide/document.md#sidebar-icons)
* [File Tree Icons](../../guide/markdown/file-tree.md)
* [Code Group Title Icons](../code/code-tabs.md#group-title-icons)

Provides syntax sugar and component support:

[Markdown Icon Syntax Sugar Support](../markdown/icons.md){.read-more}

[Icon Component Support](../components/icon.md){.read-more}

::: tip Theme Optimization for Icons
The theme employs the same parsing strategy internally for all the different ways of using icons
mentioned above. Even if you use the same icon in different locations, the same icon resources will not be loaded repeatedly.
:::

## Configuration

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: { // [!code ++:3]
      icon: { provider: 'iconify' } // Supported by default
    }
  })
})
```

## Configuration Options

### provider

* **Type**: `'iconify' | 'iconfont' | 'fontawesome'`
* **Default**: `'iconify'`

Icon provider

### prefix

* **Type**: `string`
* **Default**: `''` (Different icon providers have different default values)
* **Details**:

  Icon prefix

  * When provider is `iconify`, defaults to `''`. Set the iconify collection as prefix, e.g., `mdi`.
  * When provider is `iconfont`, defaults to `'iconfont icon-'`
  * When provider is `fontawesome`, defaults to `'fas'`. Optional values are:

    ```ts
    type FontAwesomePrefix

# Image Preview
In the theme, images support click-to-enlarge preview by default. A preview list is generated by scanning images within the document content.

This feature is powered by the [@vuepress/plugin-photo-swipe](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/en/plugins/features/photo-swipe.html) plugin.

## Configuration

Image preview is enabled by default. The behavior can be modified through the following configuration:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: {
      photoSwipe: {
        // Image selector
        selector: '.vp-doc :not(a) > img:not([no-view],.no-view,.ignore)',
        download: true, // Whether to show the download button
        fullscreen: true, // Whether to show the fullscreen button
        scrollToClose: true, // Whether to close the current image when scrolling
      }
    }
  })
})
```

For more configuration options, please refer to [@vuepress/plugin-photo-swipe](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/en/plugins/features/photo-swipe.html).

## Ignoring Image Preview

Image preview can be disabled by using the `no-view` or `ignore` class names, or the `no-view` attribute.

```md
![](path/to/image){.no-view}
![](path/to/image){.ignore}
![](path/to/image){no-view}

<img src="path/to/image" class="no-view">
<img src="path/to/image" class="ignore">
<img src="path/to/image" no-view>
```

# LLMs txt
## Overview

Add [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) to your site to provide LLM-friendly content.

**Related Plugin**: [@vuepress/plugin-llms](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/ai/llms.html)

## Why llms.txt?

Large Language Models increasingly rely on website information but face a key limitation:
their context window is too small to fully process most websites.
Converting complex HTML pages containing navigation, ads, and JavaScript into LLM-friendly plain text is both difficult and imprecise.

While websites serve both human readers and LLMs, the latter benefit from more concise,
expert-level information collected in one accessible location.
This is particularly important for use cases like development environments where LLMs need quick access to programming documentation and APIs.

Add a `/llms.txt` Markdown file to your website to provide LLM-friendly content.
This file provides brief background information, guidelines, and links to detailed Markdown files.

## Features

The plugin retrieves all Markdown files from your documentation source directory and converts them into LLM-friendly plain text files.

::: file-tree

* .vuepress/dist
  * llms.txt
  * llms-full.txt
  * markdown-examples.html
  * markdown-examples.md
  * …
    :::

Click the links below to view the llms.txt files for this documentation site:

* [llms.txt](/llms.txt){.no-icon}
* [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt){.no-icon}

::: tip
The plugin only generates `llms.txt` files and other LLM-friendly documentation files during
production builds, i.e., when executing the `vuepress build` command, and outputs them to the `.vuepress/dist` directory.

:::

[View the complete feature description in the **Plugin Official Documentation**](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/ai/llms.html#%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD){.read-more}

## Configuration

This feature is not enabled by default in the theme. You can enable it through the `llmstxt` configuration option:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Use the theme's built-in default configuration
    // llmstxt: true,

    // Use custom configuration
    llmstxt: {
      locale: '/',
      // ...other configurations
    },

    // Can also configure via `plugins.llmstxt`, but not recommended
    plugins: {
      llmstxt: true
    }
  }),
})
```

[View the complete configuration options in the **Plugin Official Documentation**](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/plugins/ai/llms.html#options){.read-more}

## Components

To further enhance interaction between your documentation site and LLMs,
you can add the `<PageContextMenu />` component to your documentation site.

This component is not built-in but is implemented as an additional feature of the theme.
Therefore, you need to manually import it and place it in an appropriate location through [component slots](../../guide/custom/slots.md):

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineAsyncComponent, h } from 'vue'
import { Layout } from 'vuepress-theme-plume/client'
import PageContextMenu from 'vuepress-theme-plume/features/PageContextMenu.vue' // [!code ++]
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

export default defineClientConfig({
  layouts: {
    Layout: h(Layout, null, {
      // Add PageContextMenu to the doc-title-after slot, i.e., to the right of the article title
      'doc-title-after': () => h(PageContextMenu), // [!code ++]
    }),
  },
})
```

You can experience this component's functionality to the right of the current page's title.

::: important
This component relies entirely on the `@vuepress/plugin-llms` plugin and can only be used when you have enabled this plugin's functionality.

Therefore, the functionality provided by this component **is only available in the built production package**.
:::

## Markup Extensions

### `<llm-only>`

You can add content in a file that is visible to LLMs but not to humans, which helps set special instructions,
such as "Refer to basic-queries for demos," "Do not execute...", "Always use... in cases of...", etc.

To do this, wrap the content with the `<llm-only>` tag.

```md
<llm-only>

## Section for LLMs

This content appears only in the generated LLM file and will not include the `<llm-only>` tag itself.

</llm-only>
```

You can also use the `<llm-only>` tag inline, but note that only one `<llm-only>` tag can be included per line;
otherwise, it will cause a parsing error.

```md
Check the plugin API guide for documentation on creating plugins.

<llm-only>For LLMs only</llm-only>
```

### `<llm-exclude>`

You can add content in a file that is visible to humans but not to LLMs, which is the opposite of `<llm-only>`:

```md
<llm-exclude>

## Section for humans

This content will not appear in the files generated for LLMs.

</llm-exclude>
```

You can also use the `<llm-exclude>` tag inline, but note that only one `<llm-only>` tag can be included per line;
otherwise, it will cause a parsing error.

```md
Check the plugin API guide for documentation on creating plugins.

<llm-exclude>For humans only</llm-exclude>
```

# Replace Assets
## Overview

This feature is powered by the [@vuepress/plugin-replace-assets](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/en/plugins/tools/replace-assets.html) plugin.

It replaces local asset links within the site, such as images, videos, audio, PDFs, and other resources, rewriting local asset paths to new addresses.

## Why is this feature needed?

Many users choose to store site assets on CDN services to accelerate site access and improve availability.

In this process, assets typically need to be uploaded to the CDN service first, then CDN links are obtained, and finally used in the site content.

This may seem straightforward, but in practice, it often requires repeatedly performing:

```txt
Upload assets → Get asset links → Use full asset links in content
```

During this process, content creation is frequently interrupted.

This feature aims to solve this problem. During content creation,
you only need to use local asset paths directly, and the theme will handle the asset path replacement at the appropriate stage.

::: important This feature does not modify source files; replacements are only made in the compiled content.
:::

## Usage

The feature is disabled by default in the theme. You can enable it in the configuration:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // ReplaceAssetsPluginOptions
    replaceAssets: 'https://cdn.example.com' // [!code ++]
  })
})
```

\==It's recommended to enable asset path replacement only for production builds, using local asset paths directly during development=={.important}

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import process from 'node:process'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' // [!code ++]

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Enable only in production environment
    replaceAssets: isProd ? 'https://cdn.example.com' : false // [!code ++]
  })
})
```

### Asset Management

**You should store assets in the [.vuepress/public](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/assets.html#public-files) directory**:

```sh
./docs
├── .vuepress
│ └── public  # [!code hl:6]
│     ├── images
│     │   ├── foo.jpg
│     │   └── bar.jpg
│     └── medias
│         └── foo.mp4
└── README.md
```

::: tip Why store assets in this directory?
When the site is compiled and ready for deployment, we can easily upload files from this directory directly to the CDN.
:::

In markdown, use local asset paths directly:

```md
![foo](/images/foo.jpg)

<img src="/images/foo.jpg">
```

In `javascript`:

```js
const foo = '/images/foo.jpg'

const img = document.createElement('img')
img.src = '/images/foo.jpg'
```

And in style files:

```css
.foo {
  background: url('/images/foo.jpg');
}
```

The plugin will correctly identify these assets and replace them in the compiled content.

:::warning The plugin does not support identifying concatenated paths like `'/images/' + 'foo.jpg'`.
:::

## Configuration Reference

```ts
/**
 * Asset link replacement configuration
 */
type ReplaceAssetsPluginOptions
  = | Replacement
    | ReplacementRule
    | ReplacementRule[]
    | ReplaceAssetsOptions

/**
 * - `string`: Prepended to the original asset link
 * - `function`: Returns the replaced asset link
 */
type Replacement = string | ((url: string) => string)

interface ReplacementRule {
  /**
   * Match asset links
   */
  find: RegExp | string
  /**
   * Asset link replacement
   */
  replacement: Replacement
}

interface ReplaceAssetsOptions {
  /**
   * Custom asset replacement rules
   */
  rules?: ReplacementRule | ReplacementRule[]
  /**
   * Replacement for built-in asset matching rules
   */
  all?: Replacement
  /**
   * Replacement for built-in image asset matching rules
   */
  image?: Replacement
  /**
   * Replacement for built-in media asset matching rules
   */
  media?: Replacement
}
```

## Built-in Asset Matching Rules

For convenience, the theme plugin provides built-in asset matching rules that you can use directly.

* `image`: Finds image assets, including local image resource links with formats `['apng','bmp','png','jpeg','jpg','jfif','pjpeg','pjp','gif','svg','ico','webp','avif','cur','jxl']`
* `media`: Finds media assets, including local media resource links with formats `['mp4','webm','ogg','mp3','wav','flac','aac','opus','mov','m4a','vtt','pdf']`
* `all`: Finds both image and media assets, combining both `image` and `media` rules

When directly passing a **asset link prefix** or **asset link replacement function**, the theme uses the `all` rule to replace asset links.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import process from 'node:process'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // replaceAssets: 'https://cdn.example.com' // [!code hl]
    replaceAssets: url => `https://cdn.example.com${url}` // [!code ++]
  })
})
```

You can also apply different asset link prefixes or replacement functions to different built-in rules:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import process from 'node:process'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // replaceAssets: {  // [!code hl:4]
    //   image: 'https://image.cdn.com/',
    //   media: 'https://media.cdn.com/'
    // },
    replaceAssets: { // [!code ++:4]
      image: url => `https://image.cdn.com${url}`,
      media: url => `https://media.cdn.com${url}`
    }
  })
})
```

## Custom Asset Matching Rules

You can also define custom asset matching rules:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import process from 'node:process'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    replaceAssets: { // [!code ++:4]
      find: /^\/images\/.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|webp|avif)$/,
      replacement: url => `https://image.cdn.com${url}`
    }
  })
})
```

You can also define multiple matching rules:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import process from 'node:process'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    replaceAssets: [ // [!code ++:12]
      // Find image assets
      {
        find: /^\/images\/.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|webp|avif)$/,
        replacement: 'https://image.cdn.com'
      },
      // Find media assets
      {
        find: /^\/medias\/.*\.(mp4|webm|ogg|mp3|wav|flac|aac|m3u8|m3u|flv|pdf)$/,
        replacement: url => `https://media.cdn.com${url}`
      },
    ]
  })
})
```

**`find` Field Explanation**

The `find` field is used to match asset links and can be a **regular expression** or **string**.

When a `string` is provided, if it starts with `^` or ends with `$`, it will be automatically converted to a **regular expression**.
Otherwise, it will check if the asset link ends with `find` or starts with `find`.

```txt
'^/images/foo.jpg' -> /^\/images\/foo.jpg/
'/images/foo.jpg$' -> /^\/images\/foo.jpg$/
```

::: important All matched asset paths start with `/`.

# Article Watermark
## Overview

Article watermarking is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-watermark](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/features/watermark.html).

The theme supports adding watermarks to articles. Both full-page watermarks and content-area watermarks
are supported, along with image watermarks and text watermarks.

## Enabling Watermark

Watermark functionality is disabled by default in the theme. You need to enable it in the theme configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // watermark: true,
    watermark: {
      // enabled: false,  // boolean type to control global enablement
      enabled: page => true, // function type to filter which pages enable watermark
      delay: 500, // Delay for adding watermark. In milliseconds.

      /**
       * Whether to use full-page watermark, defaults to `true`.
       * When set to `false`, the watermark is only displayed in the content area.
       */
      fullPage: true,

      /** @see https://zhensherlock.github.io/watermark-js-plus/zh/config/ */
      watermarkOptions: {
        content: 'your watermark',
        // ...
      }
    }
  })
})
```

### Global Enablement

When `plugins.watermark` is set to `true`, the theme enables watermark globally.

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    watermark: true,
  })
})
```

### Partial Page Enablement

The theme provides two methods to control watermark enablement on specific pages.

#### watermark.enabled

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    watermark: {
      // Pages returning true will enable watermark, others will disable it
      enabled: page => page.path.includes('/article/'),
    }
  })
})
```

#### frontmatter.watermark

Add `frontmatter.watermark` as `true` in the md file:

```md
---
watermark: true
---
```

You can also customize the watermark configuration for the current page:

```md
---
watermark:
  content: My Custom Content
  globalAlpha: 0.2
  rotate: 45
---
```

## Image Watermark

The theme supports using images as watermarks.

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    watermark: {
      watermarkOptions: {
        contentType: 'image',
        image: '/images/watermark.png',
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        imageWidth: 100,
        imageHeight: 100,
      }
    }
  })
})
```

You can also add configuration in the md file to set watermark for the current page:

```md
---
watermark:
  contentType: image
  image: /images/watermark.png
  width: 200
  height: 200
  imageWidth: 100
  imageHeight: 100
---
```

### Example

[Image Watermark](/article/i4cuuonn/)

## Text Watermark

The theme supports using text as watermarks.

```ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    watermark: {
      watermarkOptions: {
        content: 'Custom Text',
        fontColor: '#fff', // Text color
      }
    }
  })
})
```

You can also add configuration in the md file to set watermark for the current page:

```md
---
watermark:
  content: Custom Text
  fontColor: #fff
---
```

## Frontmatter

The theme supports adding `frontmatter.watermark` in md files to set watermarks for individual pages.

```md
---
watermark:
  content: My Custom Content
---
```

For supported configuration options, please refer to: [watermark-js-plus](https://zhensherlock.github.io/watermark-js-plus/zh/config/)

Additionally, `fullPage` is supported to control whether to display the watermark full-screen.

```md
---
watermark:
  fullPage: false
---
```

## Examples

* [Content Watermark](/article/2z59hh8g/)
* [Full-page Watermark](/article/97s6ha1e/)

# Friend Links Page
## Friend Links

The friend links page is not automatically generated, but you can create it as needed.

Create any `*.md` file in your `{sourceDir}/` directory, such as `friends.md`. Then configure it using `frontmatter` in this file.

```md title="friends.md"
---
friends: true
title: Friend Links
description: Description text for friend links
permalink: /friends/
cols: 2
contentPosition: after
list:
  -
    name: pengzhanbo
    link: https://github.com/pengzhanbo
    avatar: https://github.com/pengzhanbo.png
    desc: Even if slow, persist without stop; even if falling behind, even if failing, one must be able to reach the goal they are heading towards.
  -
    name: pengzhanbo

    avatar: https://github.com/pengzhanbo.png
    desc: Even if slow, persist without stop; even if falling behind, even if failing, one must be able to reach the goal they are heading towards.
---

Custom content <!-- Markdown content will be inserted into the friend links page -->
```

The theme will generate the friend links page based on the configuration.

You need to manually configure the entry link for the friend links page in an appropriate location in the `navbar`.

# Layout Slots
## Overview

The theme provides extensive layout slots through `<Layout />` and `<NotFound />` components,
allowing content injection at different positions of the page. This enables users to personalize the theme according to their needs.

## Usage

Taking `<Layout />` as an example, first create a client configuration file: `.vuepress/client.ts`:

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'
import Layout from './layouts/Layout.vue'

export default defineClientConfig({
  layouts: {
    Layout,
  },
})
```

::: info
The `Layout` name in `layouts` is fixed. This uses JavaScript shorthand syntax,
essentially equivalent to `Layout: Layout`, which is crucial for implementing layout slots.
The same rule applies to `NotFound`.

Other components passed that are not `Layout`/`NotFound` are considered custom layout components.
:::

Then, create `.vuepress/layouts/Layout.vue` as the default component for layout slots,
and import the current theme's `<Layout />` component in this file.

```vue {7-11} title=".vuepress/layouts/Layout.vue"
<script setup>
import { Layout } from 'vuepress-theme-plume/client' // [!code hl]
</script>

<template>
  <Layout>
    <template #page-bottom>
      <div class="custom-content">
        Custom Content
      </div>
    </template>
  </Layout>
</template>

<style>
.custom-content {
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
```

Content injection can also be implemented using render functions in `.vuepress/client.ts`:

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/client.ts

```ts
import { h } from 'vue'
import { Layout } from 'vuepress-theme-plume/client'
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'
import CustomContent from './components/CustomContent.vue'

export default defineClientConfig({
  layouts: {
    Layout: () => h(Layout, null, {
      'page-bottom': () => h(CustomContent),
    }),
  },
})
```

@tab .vuepress/components/CustomContent.vue

```vue
<template>
  <div class="custom-content">
    Custom Content
  </div>
</template>
```

:::

## Slots

::: info
You can preview <https://plume-layout-slots.netlify.app> to see the positions of all available slots in the site.

# Internationalization
This guide will help you quickly configure multi-language support for your VuePress theme.
With simple directory structure and configuration adjustments, you can achieve a professional internationalized site.

## Directory Structure Planning

First, create a directory structure that meets multi-language requirements.
The following example shows a project layout supporting Chinese, English, and French:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * **en**        # English documentation directory
    * foo.md
    * README.md   # English homepage
  * **fr**        # French documentation directory
    * foo.md
    * README.md   # French homepage
  * foo.md
  * README.md     # Chinese homepage
    :::

**Directory Structure Explanation**:

* `docs/en/` - Stores English version documents
* `docs/fr/` - Stores French version documents
* `docs/` - Stores default language (Chinese) documents

::: Important Maintain File Structure Consistency
Maintain identical file names and directory structures across different language directories.
This ensures the theme can correctly navigate to the corresponding language version of documents during language switching.
:::

## VuePress Basic Configuration

### Setting Default Language

Declare the default language in the configuration file `.vuepress/config.ts`:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'

export default defineUserConfig({
  // Set default language code
  lang: 'zh-CN', // [!code ++]
  // Configure multi-language support
  locales: {
    '/': { lang: 'zh-CN', title: 'Blog' }, // Simplified Chinese as default language
  }
})
```

### Adding Other Language Support

Extend the `locales` configuration to support more languages:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'

export default defineUserConfig({
  lang: 'zh-CN',
  locales: {
    '/': { lang: 'zh-CN', title: 'Blog' }, // Simplified Chinese
    '/en/': { lang: 'en-US', title: 'Blog' }, // American English // [!code ++]
    '/fr/': { lang: 'fr-FR', title: 'Le blog' }, // French // [!code ++]
  }
})
```

**Configuration Key Points**:

* The keys in `locales` (such as `/en/`) correspond to language folder names in the documentation directory
* These keys also serve as access path prefixes for each language's pages
* Each language must have the correct `lang` attribute set, even if only using a single language

::: Tip Language Code Standards

* **Path Keys**: Follow [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) standard (e.g., use `/en/` for English)
* **Language Codes**: Use [BCP47](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) standard format (e.g., use `en-US` for English)
  :::

## Theme Multi-language Configuration

Customize interface elements for each language through the `locales` field in theme configuration:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  lang: 'zh-CN', // [!code focus:6]
  locales: {
    '/': { lang: 'zh-CN', title: 'Blog' },
    '/en/': { lang: 'en-US', title: 'Blog' },
    '/fr/': { lang: 'fr-FR', title: 'Le blog' },
  },
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Theme-level multi-language configuration
    locales: { // [!code focus:20]
      // Simplified Chinese configuration
      '/': {
        selectLanguageName: '简体中文',
        navbar: [
          { text: '首页', link: '/' },
          { text: '博客', link: '/blog/' },
        ]
      },
      // English configuration
      '/en/': {
        selectLanguageName: 'English',
        navbar: [
          { text: 'Home', link: '/en/' },
          { text: 'Blog', link: '/en/blog/' },
        ]
      },
      // French configuration
      '/fr/': { // [!code focus:7]
        selectLanguageName: 'Français',
        navbar: [
          { text: 'Accueil', link: '/fr/' },
          { text: 'Le Blog', link: '/fr/blog/' },
        ]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

**Key Configuration Items**:

* `selectLanguageName`: Language name displayed in the language selector
* `navbar`: Navigation bar configuration unique to each language
* All theme configuration items support overriding by language in `locales`

## Configuration Consistency Requirements

Ensure path keys in VuePress configuration exactly match those in theme configuration:

```ts
export default {
// VuePress configuration
  locales: {
    '/': { /* Chinese configuration */ },
    '/en/': { /* English configuration */ },
  },

  // Theme configuration
  theme: plumeTheme({
    locales: {
      '/': { /* Chinese theme configuration */ },
      '/en/': { /* English theme configuration */ }
    }
  })
}
```

## Further Reading

* [Theme Locales Configuration](../../config/theme.md#locale-configuration) - Learn about language-specific theme behavior configurations
* [Multi-language Text Configuration](../../config/locales.md) - Master internationalization customization methods for interface text

With the above configurations, your documentation site will have complete multi-language support capabilities,
providing users with a more friendly internationalized access experience.

# Abbreviations
## Overview

**Abbreviations** refer to acronyms used in Markdown, such as professional terms like W3C, ECMA, etc.

When hovering over an abbreviation, the full name of the term is displayed, and it can also include the definition and explanation of the abbreviation.

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      abbr: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Syntax

In Markdown, use `*[Abbreviation]: Description` on a separate line to define an abbreviation.
The description can include the definition, explanation, etc., of the abbreviation.

Fill in the abbreviation within `[]`, and write the description after `:`. Markdown inline syntax can be used in the description.

If defined abbreviations appear in regular Markdown text, hovering over them will automatically display the abbreviation's explanation.

**Input:**

```md
The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C.

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium
```

**Output:**

The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C.

\*\[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
\*\[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium
\*\[ECMA]: European Computer Manufacturers Association

::: warning
Abbreviations should be independent words or phrases. For Chinese abbreviations, add spaces on both sides of the word to distinguish them.
:::

## Global Presets

For convenience, commonly used abbreviations can be preset in the configuration to avoid repeatedly
defining abbreviations in each markdown file.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      // [!code ++:4]
      abbr: {
        W3C: 'World Wide Web Consortium',
        ECMA: 'European Computer Manufacturers Association'
      },
    }
  })
})
```

It can also be achieved by configuring the `abbreviations` option in `markdown.env`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      env: {
        // [!code ++:4]
        abbreviations: {
          W3C: 'World Wide Web Consortium',
          ECMA: 'European Computer Manufacturers Association'
        }
      }
    }
  })
})
```

Globally preset abbreviations can be used in any markdown file.

**Input：**

```md
The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C.
```

**Output：**

The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C.

# Annotation
## Description

\==Annotation== is a special syntax in Markdown used to add extra information, explanations, or hints to a document.

Annotations are not directly displayed in the document; they require the user to manually click to be revealed.

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      annotation: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Syntax

The ==Annotation== syntax consists of two parts:

### Inline Annotation

Insert an annotation marker inline using the `[+label]` syntax.

The annotation marker is composed of `[+` + `label` + `]`.
To distinguish it clearly from the surrounding content, a space should be present at the left edge of `[+label]`.

`label` is the tag for the annotation and can be any string.

::: important The `+` symbol is required.
:::

### Defining Annotations

Define annotations in a separate area of the document using the `[+label]:` syntax.

The annotation definition area is composed of `[+` + `label` + `]:` + `Content`.

`label` should match the `[+label]` mentioned above and is used to identify the annotation tag.

**Content** can be written directly after the `:`:

```md
[+label]: This is the content. **Markdown** syntax can be used here.
```

**Content** can also start on the next line, but it must be indented. Consistent indentation should be maintained for multiple lines.

```md
[+label]:
  This is the content.
  The indentation is consistent, so this line is also part of the content.

  Even with a blank line above, this line is still consistently indented, so it is also content.
  **Markdown** syntax can be used.

This line is no longer indented, so the annotation definition for this tag ended on the previous line.
```

The content of the annotation definition is not rendered directly in the document.
It is presented only when the inline `[+label]` marker is clicked.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```md
This site is powered by VuePress [+vuepress].

[+vuepress]:
  VuePress is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG).
  It is specifically designed for building fast, content-centric sites.
```

**Output:**

This site is powered by VuePress \[+vuepress].

\[+vuepress]:
VuePress is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG).
It is specifically designed for building fast, content-centric sites.

### Example 2

**Multiple annotations defined with the same `label` are rendered as a list.**

**Input:**

```md
The ancient Chinese **Four Great Classical Novels** [+novels] are household names.

[+novels]:
  **"Romance of the Three Kingdoms":**

  Set against the backdrop of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, it depicts the political and military struggles between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, shaping the images of numerous historical figures such as Zhuge Liang, Cao Cao, Guan Yu, and Liu Bei.

[+novels]:
  **"Journey to the West":**

  Tells the story of the monk Xuanzang and his three disciples (Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, and the White Dragon Horse) on their journey to the West to obtain sacred Buddhist texts, filled with mythological elements and fantastical adventures.

[+novels]:
  **"Dream of the Red Chamber":**

  Set against the backdrop of the decline of the four major families Jia, Shi, Wang, and Xue, it depicts the love tragedy between Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, and Xue Baochai, revealing the corruption and decay of feudal society.

[+novels]:
  **"Water Margin":**

  Depicts the story of 108 outlaws, led by Song Jiang, who gather at Liangshan Marsh during the late Northern Song Dynasty to rebel against the imperial government, showcasing the social reality of oppression leading to rebellion.
```

## Global Presets

For convenience, commonly used content annotations can be preset in the configuration to avoid repetitive definitions in each markdown file.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      annotation: {
        vuepress: 'VuePress is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG).It is specifically designed for building fast, content-centric sites.',
        novels: [
          '**"Romance of the Three Kingdoms":**\nSet against the backdrop of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, it depicts the political and military struggles between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, shaping the images of numerous historical figures such as Zhuge Liang, Cao Cao, Guan Yu, and Liu Bei.',

  })
})
```

It can also be achieved by configuring the `annotations` option in `markdown.env`.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({

          ],
        }
      }
    }
  })
})
```

Globally preset content annotations can be used in any markdown file.

**Input:**

# Attribute Support
## Overview

Add classes, identifiers, and attributes to your Markdown.

**This feature is enabled by default.**

## Syntax

Use `{ }` after Markdown tokens to add class names, identifiers, or attributes.

```md
markdown content{.classname #id attr1=value attr2="value with spaces"}
```

### `.classname`

Start with `.` to add a class.

**Input:**

```md
__bold__{.bolder}
```

**Output:**

```html
<strong class="bolder">bold</strong>
```

### `#id`

Start with `#` to add an ID.

**Input:**

```md
## Heading{#header-1}
```

**Output:**

```html
<h2 id="header-1">Heading</h2>
```

:::tip This is commonly used for customizing anchor links for headings.
:::

### `attr=value`

**Input:**

```md
[link](https://example.com){target=_blank}
[link](https://example.com){rel="noopener noreferrer"}
```

**Output:**

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">link</a>
<a href="https://example.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>
```

### Combined Usage

**Input:**

```md
[link](https://example.com){.link #linkId target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}
```

**Output:**

```html
<a href="https://example.com" class="link" id="linkId" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>
```

### On Block-Level Tokens

Add attributes on the next line after block-level tokens.

For example, using with an unordered list:

**Input:**

```md
- list item **bold**
{.red}
```

**Output:**

```html
<ul class="red">
  <li class="red">list item <strong>bold</strong></li>
</ul>
```

For example, using with a table:

**Input:**

```md
| header1 | header2 |
| ------- | ------- |
| column1 | column2 |

{.special}  <!-- Note: an empty line is required before this -->
```

**Output:**

```html
<table class="special">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>header1</th>
      <th>header2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>column1</td>
      <td>column2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Table cells can also use attributes, commonly for cell merging:

**Input:**

```md
| A                       | B   | C   | D                |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | ---------------- |
| 1                       | 11  | 111 | 1111 {rowspan=3} |
| 2 {colspan=2 rowspan=2} | 22  | 222 | 2222             |
| 3                       | 33  | 333 | 3333             |
```

**Output:**

```html
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>D</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>111</td>
      <td rowspan="3">1111</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">2</td>
      <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

**Result:**

| A                       | B   | C   | D                |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | ---------------- |
| 1                       | 11  | 111 | 1111 {rowspan=3} |
| 2 {colspan=2 rowspan=2} | 22  | 222 | 2222             |
| 3                       | 33  | 333 | 3333             |

:::

Markdown is a markup language that can be written using a plain text editor. Through simple syntax, it allows regular text content to have formatting capabilities.

The goal of Markdown is to achieve「readability and writability」.

## Overview

The most emphasized aspect is its readability. A document written in Markdown should be directly publishable as plain text,
and should not appear to be composed of tags or formatting instructions. Markdown syntax is influenced by several existing text-to-HTML formats,
including [Setext][1], [atx][2], [Textile][3], [reStructuredText][4], [Grutatxt][5], and [EtText][6],
with the primary inspiration coming from plain text email formatting.

Thus, Markdown syntax consists entirely of punctuation marks, carefully selected to visually represent their meaning.
For example, adding asterisks around text looks like \*emphasis\*. Markdown lists look like lists.
If you've used email, blockquotes resemble quoted text.

Markdown has various derivatives to extend its functionality (e.g., tables, footnotes, embedded HTML),
features not originally available in basic Markdown. These enable conversion to formats like LaTeX, Docbook.
Notable enhanced versions include Markdown Extra, MultiMarkdown, and Maruku. These derivatives are either tool-based (e.g., Pandoc)
or website-based (e.g., GitHub, Wikipedia), maintaining basic syntax compatibility but modifying rendering effects.

## Usage

Markdown's syntax has a primary purpose: to serve as a writing language for web content. Markdown focuses on making documents easier to read and write,
thus its syntax only covers what plain text can represent.

Markdown's syntax is simple, easy to learn, and more powerful than plain text, making it popular for blogging. WordPress, the world's most popular blogging platform, supports Markdown well.

It's used for documentation, typically saved as `README.md` in software directories.

Additionally, Markdown can quickly convert to presentation slides, Word documents, LaTeX papers, or even minimal viable prototypes with minimal code. In data science, Markdown has become essential for dynamic reproducible research.

### Inline HTML

Any HTML tags not covered by Markdown can be directly written in the document. No special annotation is needed; simply include the tags.

Block-level elements like `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, and `<p>` must be separated by blank lines.
These tags cannot be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown's parser intelligently avoids adding unnecessary `<p>` tags around block elements.

For example, adding an HTML table in a Markdown file:

```md
This is a regular paragraph.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This is another regular paragraph.
```

Note that Markdown syntax is not processed within HTML blocks. For instance, you cannot use `*emphasis*` inside HTML blocks.

### Special Character Auto-Conversion

In HTML files, two characters require special handling: `<` and `&`. The `<` character starts a tag, and `&` marks an HTML entity. If you want to use these characters literally, you must use their entity forms, like `&lt;` and `&amp;`.

The `&` character can be problematic for those writing web documents. If you want to write "AT\&T," you must write "AT\&T." You also need to escape the `&` in URLs. For example, if you want to link to `http://images.google.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird`

you must convert the URL to:

```html
http://images.google.com/images?num=30&amp;q=larry+bird
```

to place it in the `href` attribute of a link tag. It's easy to forget this, and it might be the most common error detected by HTML validators.

Markdown allows you to use these characters directly, but you need to be careful with escape characters. If you use `&` in an HTML entity, it won't be converted. In other cases, it will be converted to `&amp;`. So, if you want to insert a copyright symbol in your text, you can write:

```md
&copy;
```

Markdown will not modify this text. However, if you write:

```md
AT&T
```

Markdown will convert it to:

```html
AT&amp;T
```

Similar behavior occurs with the `<` character. Since Markdown supports [inline HTML](#inline-html), if you use `<` as an HTML tag, Markdown won't convert it. But if you write:

```md
4 < 5
```

Markdown will convert it to:

```html
4 &lt; 5
```

Note that within code spans, whether inline or block, both `<` and `&` are always converted to HTML entities. This feature allows you to easily write HTML code in Markdown, as you don't have to convert all `<` and `&` in HTML syntax to HTML entities to write HTML code.

## Block Elements

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks

A paragraph is composed of one or more connected lines, and one or more blank lines separate different paragraphs. (A blank line is defined as a line that appears empty; for example, a line with only spaces and tabs is also considered a blank line.) Generally, paragraphs do not require indentation with spaces or tabs.

The phrase "composed of one or more connected lines" implies that Markdown allows forced line breaks within paragraphs. This differs from other text-to-HTML formats (including MovableType's "Convert Line Breaks" option), which convert every line break into a `<br />` tag.

If you really want to insert a `<br />` tag, add two or more spaces (` `) or a slash (`/`) at the end of the line, then press Enter.

Yes, this requires more effort to insert a `<br />`, but the method of converting every line break to `<br />` is not suitable for Markdown.
In Markdown, email-style [block quotes][bq] and multi-paragraph [lists][l] are more usable and readable when using line breaks for formatting.

### Headings

Headings indicate the structure of an article.

Markdown supports two heading syntax styles: [Setext][1] and [atx][2].

The Setext style uses underlines with `=` (for first-level headings) and `-` (for second-level headings), like:

```md
# This is an H1

## This is an H2
```

Any number of `=` or `-` characters can be used.

The Atx style (recommended) involves placing 1 to 6 `#` characters at the beginning of a line, corresponding to heading levels 1 to 6, like:

* H1: `# Header 1`
* H2: `## Header 2`
* H3: `### Header 3`
* H4: `#### Header 4`
* H5: `##### Header 5`
* H6: `###### Header 6`

### Blockquotes

Markdown uses email-style block quotes. If you're familiar with quoting in emails, you'll know how to create a block quote in a Markdown file. It looks like a forced line break with `>` at the beginning of each line:

```md
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
>
> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
```

Markdown also allows you to place `>` only at the beginning of the first line of a paragraph:

```md
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
```

Block quotes can have levels (e.g., quotes within quotes) by adding more `>` characters according to the level:

```md
> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.
```

Other Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, and code blocks, can be used within block quotes:

```md
> ## This is a header.
>
> 1. This is the first list item.
> 1. This is the second list item.
>
> Here's some example code:
>
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");
```

Any standard text editor can easily create email-style quotes. For example, in BBEdit, you can select text and choose "Increase Quote Level" from the menu.

### Lists

Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists.

Unordered lists use hyphens as list markers (you can also use asterisks or plus signs):

```md
- Red
- Green
- Blue
```

You can also (though not recommended):

```md
- Red
- Green
- Blue

* Red
* Green
* Blue
```

Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period:

```md
1. Bird
2. McHale
3. Parish
```

Importantly, the numbers you use for list markers do not affect the HTML output. The HTML for the above list would be:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Bird</li>
  <li>McHale</li>
  <li>Parish</li>
</ol>
```

If you write the list markers as:

```md
1. Bird
1. McHale
1. Parish
```

You'll still get the same HTML output. The key point is that you can make the list numbers in the Markdown file match the output, or just use `1` and not worry about the numbering.

List markers are typically placed at the left margin but can be indented by up to three spaces, with at least one space or tab after the marker.

To make lists look neater, you can align the content with consistent indentation:

```md
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
  viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
- Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
```

However, if you're lazy, you don't have to:

```md
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
  viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
- Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
```

If list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the item content in `<p>` tags. For example:

```md
- Bird
- Magic
```

Would be converted to:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Bird</li>
  <li>Magic</li>
</ul>
```

But this:

```md
- Bird

- Magic
```

Would be converted to:

```html
<ul>
  <li><p>Bird</p></li>
  <li><p>Magic</p></li>
</ul>
```

List items can contain multiple paragraphs, with each paragraph indented by 4 spaces or one tab:

```md
1. This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
    mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
    sit amet velit.

2. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
```

If every line is indented, it looks better, but again, if you're lazy, Markdown allows:

```md
- This is a list item with two paragraphs.

  This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're
  only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor
  sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

- Another item in the same list.
```

To include a quote within a list item, the `>` needs to be indented:

```md
- A list item with a blockquote:

  > This is a blockquote
  > inside a list item.
```

Accidental lists can occur with syntax like:

```md
1986. What a great season.
```

To avoid this, place a backslash before the period:

```md
1986\. What a great season.
```

### Code Blocks

For code writing or raw code of markup languages, you often need preformatted code blocks that shouldn't be formatted like regular paragraphs but displayed as-is. Markdown wraps these code blocks with `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.

Creating a code block in Markdown is simple: indent every line with 4 spaces or one tab. For example:

```md
This is a normal paragraph:

This is a code block.
```

Markdown converts this to:

```html
<p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>

<pre>
  <code>This is a code block.</code>
</pre>
```

The indentation (4 spaces or one tab) is removed, so:

```md
Here is an example of AppleScript:

tell application "Foo"
beep
end tell
```

Becomes:

```html
<p>Here is an example of AppleScript:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Foo"
  beep
end tell
</code></pre>
```

A code block continues until a line with no indentation (or the end of the file).

Within code blocks, `<`, `&`, and `>` are automatically converted to HTML entities, making it easy to insert HTML code examples. Just copy, paste, and indent, and Markdown handles the rest. For example:

````md
```html
<div class="footer">
  &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
</div>
```
````

Is converted to:

```html
<pre>
  <code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
  &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>
```

In code blocks, regular Markdown syntax isn't processed, so asterisks remain asterisks. This allows you to easily write about Markdown syntax.

If you want to include Markdown-formatted code libraries within a code block, you can nest them.

`````md
````md
```js
const a = 1
```
````
`````

Renders as

````md
```js
const a = 1
```
````

### Horizontal Rules

You can create a horizontal rule by placing three or more asterisks, hyphens, or underscores on a line. No other content should be on the line. You can also add spaces between the characters. Any of the following will create a horizontal rule:

```html
---(recommended) * * * *** ***** - - - ---------------------------------------
```

## Inline Elements

### Links

Markdown supports two types of link syntax: *inline* and *reference*.

In both cases, link text is marked with `[square brackets]`.

For an inline link, immediately after the square brackets, add parentheses with the URL. You can also include a title in quotes, like:

```html
This is [an example](http://example.com/  "Title") inline link. [This
link](http://example.net/  ) has no title attribute.
```

This produces:

```html
<p>
  This is <a href="http://example.com/  " title="Title"> an example</a> inline
  link.
</p>

<p><a href="http://example.net/  ">This link</a> has no title attribute.</p>
```

For linking to resources on the same host, you can use relative paths:

```md
See my [About](/about/) page for details.
```

Reference-style links use another set of square brackets after the link text, with an identifier for the link:

```md
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
```

Then, define the link identifier anywhere in the document:

```md
[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```

The link definition consists of:

* Square brackets with the link ID
* A colon
* One or more spaces or a tab
* The URL
* An optional title in single quotes, double quotes, or parentheses

These three link definitions are equivalent:

```md
[foo]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
[foo]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
[foo]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```

**Note:** A known issue is that Markdown.pl 1.0.1 ignores single-quoted link titles.

URLs in link definitions can be enclosed in square brackets:

```md
[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```

You can also place the title on a new line with indentation for better readability with long URLs:

```md
[id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here  "Optional Title Here"
```

Link identifiers are case-insensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation. These two links are the same:

```md
[link text][a]
[link text][a]
```

The *default link ID* feature allows you to omit the link ID, making it the same as the link text. To use this, add empty square brackets after the link text. For example:

```md
[Google][]
```

Then define the link:

```md
[google]: http://google.com/
```

Since link text can contain spaces, the simplified ID can also include multiple words:

```md
Visit [Daring Fireball][] for more information.
```

Then define the link:

```md
[daring fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/
```

Link definitions can be placed anywhere in the document, either after the paragraph where the link appears or at the end like annotations.

Here's an example of reference-style links:

```md
I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

[1]: http://google.com/  "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/  "MSN Search"
```

Using link names instead:

```md
I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from
[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].

[google]: http://google.com/  "Google"
[yahoo]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[msn]: http://search.msn.com/  "MSN Search"
```

Both methods produce the same HTML:

```html
<p>
  I get 10 times more traffic from
  <a href="http://google.com/  " title="Google">Google</a> than from
  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/  " title="Yahoo Search">Yahoo</a>
  or <a href="http://search.msn.com/  " title="MSN Search">MSN</a>.
</p>
```

For comparison, here's the inline-style version of the same content:

```md
I get 10 times more traffic from [Google](http://google.com/  "Google")
than from [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search") or
[MSN](http://search.msn.com/  "MSN Search").
```

Reference-style links are more readable. The reference-style version has 81 characters, while the inline-style version has 176, and pure HTML would have 234. In HTML, tags outnumber text.

Using Markdown's reference-style links makes the document resemble the final browser output, allowing you to keep markup details separate from the main text for uninterrupted reading.

### Emphasis

Markdown uses asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) to mark emphasis. Text surrounded by `*` or `_` is wrapped in `<em>`, while text surrounded by double `*` or `_` is wrapped in `<strong>`, like:

```md
**double asterisks** (recommended)

**double underscores** (recommended)

_single asterisks_

_single underscores_
```

This converts to:

```html
<em>single asterisks</em>

<em>single underscores</em>

<strong>double asterisks</strong>

<strong>double underscores</strong>
```

You can choose your preferred style, as long as you use the same character to open and close.

Emphasis can be added in the middle of words:

```md
un*frigging*believable
```

However, if `*` or `_` has spaces on both sides, it will be treated as regular text.

To insert literal asterisks or underscores, use a backslash:

```md
\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*
```

### Code

To mark inline code, wrap it in backticks (`` ` ``), like:

```md
Use the `printf()` function.
```

This produces:

```md
<p>Use the <code>printf()</code> function.</p>
```

To include a backtick within the code, use multiple backticks to open and close the inline code:

```md
``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``
```

This renders as:

```html
<p><code>There is a literal backtick (`) here.</code></p>
```

You can add a space at the start or end of the code span to include a backtick at the beginning:

```md
A single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``

A backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``
```

This results in:

```html
<p>A single backtick in a code span: <code>`</code></p>

<p>A backtick-delimited string in a code span: <code>`foo`</code></p>
```

Within code spans, `&` and brackets are converted to HTML entities, making it easier to insert HTML code. Markdown converts:

```md
Please don't use any `<blink>` tags.
```

To:

```html
<p>Please don't use any <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags.</p>
```

You can also write:

```md
`&#8212;` is the decimal-encoded equivalent of `&mdash;`.
```

Which produces:

```html
<p>
  <code>&amp;#8212;</code> is the decimal-encoded equivalent of
  <code>&amp;mdash;</code>.
</p>
```

### Images

Creating a natural syntax for inserting images in plain text is challenging.

Markdown uses a syntax similar to links for images, supporting both *inline* and *reference* styles.

The inline image syntax looks like:

```md
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
```

This consists of:

* An exclamation mark `!`
* Square brackets containing the image's alt text
* Parentheses containing the image URL, optionally followed by a quoted title.

Reference-style image syntax looks like:

```md
![Alt text][id]
```

Where `id` is the image reference name, defined like:

```md
[id]: url/to/image "Optional title attribute"
```

Currently, Markdown doesn't support specifying image width and height. For that, use the regular `<img>` tag.

### Other Text Styles

* Delete: `~~delete~~`
* Paragraphs: Leave a blank line between paragraphs
* Line breaks: Add two spaces at the end of a line

***

## Other

### Automatic Links

Markdown supports concise automatic link syntax for URLs and email addresses. Enclosing text in brackets automatically converts it to a link. For example:

```md
<http://example.com/>
```

Markdown converts this to:

```html
<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>
```

Automatic email links are similar, but Markdown encodes characters as hexadecimal HTML entities to confuse address-harvesting bots. For example:

```md
<address@example.com>
```

Markdown converts this to:

```html
<a
  href="&#x6D;&#x61;i&#x6C;&#x74;&#x6F;:&#x61;&#x64;&#x64;&#x72;&#x65;&#115;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#109;"
  >&#x61;&#x64;&#x64;&#x72;&#x65;&#115;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#x70;&#x6C;e&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a
>
```

This creates a clickable <address@example.com> link in the browser.

### Escape Characters

Markdown uses backslashes to insert characters that have special meaning in its syntax. For example, to use asterisks for emphasis without `<em>` tags, precede them with a backslash:

```md
\*literal asterisks\*
```

Markdown supports escaping the following characters:

* `\` backslash
* `` ` `` backtick
* `*` asterisk
* `_` underscore
* `{}` curly braces
* `[]` square brackets
* `()` parentheses
* `#` hash
* `+` plus
* `-` minus
* `.` period
* `!` exclamation mark

# Can I Use
## Overview

When writing articles, this feature provides the functionality to embed platform support information for WEB features from [can-i-use](https://caniuse.com/).

This allows for a more intuitive representation of a feature's support level when describing a specific WEB feature.

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You can enable it in the configuration file.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdownP: {
      caniuse: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

In your article's markdown file, use the following format:

```md
@[caniuse](feature)
```

For ease of use, the theme provides tool support: [caniuse Feature Search](../../../tools/caniuse.md).
You can use this tool directly to help generate the markdown code.

## Syntax

```md
@[caniuse](feature)
@[caniuse{browser_versions}](feature)
@[caniuse embed_type](feature)
@[caniuse embed_type{browser_versions}](feature)
```

:::info Using the caniuse tool provided by the theme: [caniuse feature search](../../../../tools/caniuse.md) to help generate markdown code.
:::

* `feature`

  Required. For correct values, please refer to [caniuse-embed.vercel.app](https://caniuse-embed.vercel.app/zh-CN).

* `{browser_period}`

  Optional. The support status of the current feature across multiple version cycles.

  Default value: `{-2,1}`

  Format: `{past,future}` with a value range of `-5 ~ 3`

  * Values less than `0` indicate support status in past browser version cycles.

# Chat Records
## Preface

::: chat title="User B"
{:2025-03-24 10:15:00}

{User B}
Putting chat screenshots in the documentation still looks pretty bad, is there a better way? \[doge]

{.}
Sure there is, bro, definitely sure

{.}
But is it really okay to post chat records like this?

{User B}
Proof of our fiery debates is worth keeping \[doge]

{:2025-03-24 15:32:00}

{.}
Good news: the docs now support chat records!

{.}
Bad news: I've used you as the example \[doge]

{User B}
???
:::

## Overview

In Markdown, wrapping specially formatted text content within a `::: chat` container allows you to display ==chat records== within the documentation.

::: warning This is a feature you likely won't need most of the time.
Please consider carefully whether you should use it when the need arises.
Filter out any private or sensitive content yourself.
:::

## Enable

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      chat: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Usage

Within a `::: chat` container, use specific markers to identify the sender and timestamp of messages,
which will then render the chat record in the documentation.

```md
::: chat title="Title"
{:date}     <!-- Mark the starting timestamp -->

{username}  <!-- Mark the sender -->
xxx         <!-- The sender's message content -->

{.}         <!-- Mark as sent by the current user -->
xxx         <!-- The current user's message content -->
:::
```

* `{:date}` Marks the starting timestamp (Optional). Use the format `{:` + date + `}`. `date` can be in common date formats.

  The theme does not process `date` in any way; it simply renders it.

* `{username}` Marks the sender of the subsequent content. Use the format `{` + username + `}`. `username` can be any string.

* `{.}` Marks the message as sent by the current user.

## Example

**Input:**

```md
::: chat title="Title"
{:2025-03-24 10:15:00}

{User 1}
Message from User 1

{.}
Message from the current user

{User 2}
Message from User 2

{.}
Message from the current user
:::
```

**Output:**

::: chat title="Title"
{:2025-03-24 10:15:00}

{User 1}
Message from User 1

{.}
Message from the current user

{User 2}
Message from User 2

{.}
Message from the current user

# Code Tree
## Overview

In Markdown, use the `::: code-tree` container or `@[code-tree](dir_path)` syntax to display a code block area with a file tree.

Compared to code block grouping, code trees can more clearly present the organizational structure of code files and their dependency relationships.

## Enable

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      codeTree: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Usage

The theme provides two usage methods:

### code-tree Container

````md
::: code-tree title="Project Name" height="400px" entry="filepath"
```lang title="filepath" :active
<!-- code content-->
```

```lang title="filepath"
<!-- code content-->
```
<!-- More code blocks -->
:::
````

Use the `::: code-tree` container to wrap multiple code blocks.

* Use `title="Project Name"` after `::: code-tree` to declare the code tree title
* Use `height="400px"` after `::: code-tree` to declare the code tree height
* Use `entry="filepath"` after `::: code-tree` to declare the default expanded file path
* Use `title="filepath"` after the code block \`\`\` lang to declare the current code block's file path
* If `entry="filepath"` is not declared in `::: code-tree`, you can use `:active` after the code block
  \`\`\` lang to declare the current code block as expanded
* If no expanded file path is specified, the first file will be expanded by default

::: details Why use `title="filepath"` instead of `filepath="filepath"` on code blocks?
Because the theme already [supports title syntax on code blocks](../code/features.md#code-block-titles).
Continuing to use the existing syntax support reduces the learning curve.
:::

**Input:**

````md :collapsed-lines
::: code-tree title="Vue App" height="400px" entry="src/main.ts"
```vue title="src/components/HelloWorld.vue"
<template>
  <div class="hello">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h3>vuepress-theme-plume</h3>
    <HelloWorld />
  </div>
</template>
```

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "Vue App",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite"
  }
}
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: code-tree title="Vue App" height="400px" entry="src/main.ts"

```vue title="src/components/HelloWorld.vue"
<template>
  <div class="hello">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h3>vuepress-theme-plume</h3>
    <HelloWorld />
  </div>
</template>
```

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "Vue App",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite"
  }
}
```

:::

### Importing code-tree from Directory

The theme supports importing `code-tree` from a directory using the following syntax:

```md
<!-- Simple import -->
@[code-tree](dir_path)

<!-- With additional configuration -->
@[code-tree title="Project Name" height="400px" entry="filepath"](dir_path)
```

* **dir\_path**:
  When an absolute path is provided (starting with `/`), the search begins from the source directory of the documentation site.
  When a relative path is provided (starting with `.`), it is relative to the current Markdown file.

* **title**: Code tree title, optional, defaults to empty

* **height**: Code tree height, optional, defaults to empty

* **entry**: Default expanded file path, optional, defaults to the first file

**Input:**

```md
<!-- This directory is the theme repository's `docs/.vuepress/collections/` -->
@[code-tree title="Collections Configuration" height="400px" entry="index.ts"](/.vuepress/collections)
```

**Output:**

@[code-tree title="Collections Configuration" height="400px" entry="index.ts"](/.vuepress/collections)

# Collapse Panel
## Overview

In markdown, use the `::: collapse` container with markdown unordered list syntax to implement ==collapse panels==.

* Supports ==accordion== mode via the `accordion` setting

## Enable

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      collapse: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Usage

In markdown, use the `::: collapse` container with markdown unordered list syntax. Each item represents a separate collapsible section.

```md title="collapse.md"
::: collapse
- Title 1        <!-- Title, click to control expand/collapse -->
                 <!-- Must have an empty line between title and content -->
  Content        <!-- Content, the collapsible area -->

- Title 2

  Content
:::
```

For each list item:

* Everything from the **first line** to the **first empty line** is considered the **title**

* **After the first empty line**: Content

:::important Please ensure correct indentation
:::

**A simple example:**

**Input:**

```md
::: collapse
- Title 1

  Content

- Title 2

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: collapse

* Title 1

  Content

* Title 2

  Content
  :::

## Configuration

After the `::: collapse` container syntax, follow with configuration options:

* `accordion`: Sets the collapse panel to ==accordion== mode. In accordion mode,
  only one panel can be expanded at a time; clicking other panels will close the previously opened panel.
* `expand`: Expands panels by default. Invalid in accordion mode.

In list items, before the title, use special markers `:+` / `:-` to set the initial state of the current item to **expanded / collapsed**.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

**Input:**

```md
::: collapse
- Title 1

  Content

- Title 2

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: collapse

* Title 1

  Content

* Title 2

  Content
  :::

### Expand All by Default

Add the `expand` option to expand all panels by default.

**Input:**

```md /expand/
::: collapse expand
- Title 1

  Content

- Title 2

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: collapse expand

* Title 1

  Content

* Title 2

  Content
  :::

### Accordion Mode

Add the `accordion` option to set accordion mode, where only one panel can be expanded at a time.

```md /accordion/
::: collapse accordion
- Title 1

  Content

- Title 2

  Content

- Title 3

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: collapse accordion

* Title 1

  Content

* Title 2

  Content

* Title 3

  Content
  :::

### `:+` Mark Item as Expanded

Collapse panels are closed by default. Use `:+` to mark items with an initial expanded state.

**Input:**

```md /:+/
::: collapse
- Title 1

  Content

- :+ Title 2

  Content

- :+ Title 3

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: collapse

* Title 1

  Content

* :+ Title 2

  Content

* :+ Title 3

  Content
  :::

### `:-` Mark Item as Collapsed

When collapse panel is configured with `expand`, all panels are expanded by default. Use `:-` to mark items with an initial collapsed state.

**Input:**

```md /:-/
::: collapse expand
- Title 1

  Content

- :- Title 2

  Content

- Title 3

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: collapse expand

* Title 1

  Content

* :- Title 2

  Content

* Title 3

  Content

# Environment preset
## Overview

Environment presets (`markdown.env`) can be used to configure preset values for the Markdown rendering environment,

such as reference links, content annotations, abbreviations, etc., thereby avoiding repetitive definitions in each Markdown file.

**Environment presets can take effect in any Markdown file.**

## Configuration

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      env: {
        // reference
        references: {
          vuepress: 'https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/'
        },
        // abbreviation
        abbreviations: {
          HTML: 'Hypertext Markup Language'
        },
        // annotation
        annotations: {
          vuepress: 'VuePress is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG).It is specifically designed for building fast, content-centric sites.'
        }
      }
    }
  })
})
```

The above configuration is equivalent to including the following in any markdown file:

```md
[vuepress]: https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/

*[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language

[+vuepress]: VuePress is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG).It is specifically designed for building fast, content-centric sites.
```

Therefore, these environment presets can be used in any markdown file:

```md
Link reference: [vuepress][vuepress]

Abbreviation: HTML

Content note: vuepress [+vuepress]
```

Link reference: [vuepress][vuepress]

Abbreviation: HTML

Content note: vuepress \[+vuepress]

[vuepress]: https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/

\*\[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language

\[+vuepress]:
VuePress is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG).
It is specifically designed for building fast, content-centric sites.

## Interface

```ts
interface MarkdownEnvPreset {
  /**
   * Reference links
   */
  references?: {
    [label: string]: string | { title?: string, href: string }
  }
  /**
   * Abbreviation
   */
  abbreviations?: {
    [label: string]: string
  }
  /**
   * Annotation
   */
  annotations?: {
    [label: string]: string | string[]
  }
}
```

## Header Anchors

Headers automatically have anchors applied.

### Custom Anchors

To specify a custom anchor for a header instead of using the auto-generated one, add a suffix to the header:

```md
# Using a Custom Anchor {#my-anchor}
```

This allows linking to the header as `#my-anchor` instead of the default `#using-a-custom-anchor`.

## Links

Internal and external links are specially processed.

The theme automatically generates a new link for each md file and stores it in the `permalink` of the corresponding md file's frontmatter.
You can modify these links at any time.
You can also disable this feature via the `theme.autoFrontmatter` option, reverting to VuePress's default behavior.

### Internal Links

There are three ways to use internal links:

* Use the generated `permalink` as the target for the internal link.
* Use the relative path of the md file as the target for the internal link.
* Use the absolute path of the md file as the target for the internal link.
  The absolute path `/` indicates starting from the `${sourceDir}` directory.

```md
[Markdown](/guide/markdown/)

[Markdown](./basic.md)
```

Renders as:

[Markdown](/guide/markdown/)

[Markdown](./basic.md)

### External Links

External links have `target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"`:

[VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/)

## GitHub-Style Tables

**Input:**

```md
| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |
```

**Output:**

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

## Table of Contents

**Input:**

```md
[[TOC]]
```

**Output:**

\[\[TOC]]

## Superscripts and Subscripts

* Use `^ ^` for superscript notation.
* Use `~ ~` for subscript notation.

**Input:**

```md
- 19^th^
- H~2~O
```

**Output:**

* 19^th^
* H~2~O

## Custom Alignment

**Input:**

```md
::: left
Left-aligned content
:::

::: center
Centered content
:::

::: right
Right-aligned content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: left
Left-aligned content
:::

::: center
Centered content
:::

::: right
Right-aligned content
:::

## Task Lists

**Input:**

```md
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

**Output:**

* \[ ] Task 1
* \[x] Task 2
* \[ ] Task 3

## Footnotes

**Input:**

```md
The farthest distance in the world Is not the distance between life and death But you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you.[^footnote1]。

[^footnote1]: From India.Rabindranath Tagore **The Farthest Distance in the World**
```

**Output:**

The farthest distance in the world Is not the distance between life and death But you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you.\[^footnote1]。

# Field Container
## Overview

In Markdown, use the `::: field` container to describe field information, including field name,
field type, whether it's required, default value, description, and other details.

It's suitable for describing fields in configurations, component Props, and similar scenarios.

You can also use the additional `:::: field-group` container to group multiple `::: field` containers.

## Enable

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      field: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

## Syntax

```md
<!-- Single Field -->
::: field name="Field Name" type="Type" required default="Default Value"
Field description information
:::

<!-- Field Group -->
:::: field-group

::: field name="Field Name" type="Type" required default="Default Value"
Field description information
:::

::: field name="Field Name" type="Type" required default="Default Value"
Field description information
:::

::::
```

## Properties

:::: field-group
::: field name="name" required type="string"
Field name
:::

::: field name="type" type="string" optional
Field type
:::

::: field name="required" type="boolean" optional
Whether the field is required
:::

::: field name="optional" type="boolean" optional
Whether the field is optional
:::

::: field name="deprecated" type="boolean" optional
Whether the field is deprecated
:::

::: field name="default" type="string" optional
Default value. If it's an empty string, use `default="''"`
:::
::::

## Examples

**Input:**

```md
::: field name="theme" type="ThemeConfig" required default="{}"
Theme configuration
:::

::: field name="enabled" type="boolean" optional default="true"
Whether enabled
:::
```

**Output:**

::: field name="theme" type="ThemeConfig" required default="{}"
Theme configuration
:::

::: field name="enabled" type="boolean" optional default="true"

# File Tree
## Overview

In Markdown, you can use the `file-tree` container to display directory structures with file icons and collapsible subdirectories.

## Syntax

Within the `::: file-tree` container, use the built-in **Markdown unordered list syntax** to specify the organization of files and directories.
Use nested list items to create subdirectories; to indicate that a directory's contents should not be
displayed, simply add a slash `/` at the end of the list item.

The following syntax can be used to customize the appearance of the file tree:

* Emphasize file or directory names by making them bold, e.g., `**README.md**`
* Add comments to files or directories by adding additional text after the name
* Mark files or directories as **added** or **deleted** by prefixing the name with `++` or `--`
* Use `...` or `…` as the name to add placeholder files and directories.
* Add `icon="simple"` or `icon="colored"` after `:::file-tree` to switch to simple icons or colored icons. The default is colored icons.
* Add `title="xxxx"` after `:::file-tree` to add a title to the file tree.

**Input:**

```md /++/ /--/
::: file-tree

- docs
  - .vuepress
    - ++ config.ts
  - -- page1.md
  - README.md
- theme  A **theme** directory
  - client
    - components
      - **Navbar.vue**
    - composables
      - useNavbar.ts
    - styles
      - navbar.css
    - config.ts
  - node/
- package.json
- pnpm-lock.yaml
- .gitignore
- README.md
- …
:::
```

**Output:**

::: file-tree

* docs
  * .vuepress
    * ++ config.ts
  * \-- page1.md
  * README.md
* theme  A **theme** directory
  * client
    * components
      * **Navbar.vue**
    * composables
      * useNavbar.ts
    * styles
      * navbar.css
    * config.ts
  * node/
* package.json
* pnpm-lock.yaml
* .gitignore
* README.md
* …
  :::

## Using Simple Icons

**Input:**

```md
::: file-tree icon="simple"
- docs
  - .vuepress
    - config.ts
  - page1.md
  - README.md
- package.json
:::
```

**Output:**

::: file-tree icon="simple"

* docs
  * .vuepress
    * config.ts
  * page1.md
  * README.md
* package.json
  :::

## Configuration

You can configure the default icon type for file trees in the `markdown.fileTree` option:

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      fileTree: {
        icon: 'simple', // 'simple' | 'colored'
      }
    },
  })
})
```

:::

::: tip Concerned about colored icons affecting build bundle size?
You don't need to worry. The colored icons for the file tree are also resolved from `iconify`.
We recommend installing the `@iconify/json` package locally in your project.
The theme will automatically parse the icon data from `@iconify/json` into local icon resources.
Even if you use the same icon multiple times across different pages
(including navigation bars, sidebars, icon components, etc.), only one copy of the resource will exist for each icon!

Each colored icon is approximately `1kb ~ 2kb` in size.
Even if your file tree extensively uses 100+ different icons, the impact on the final build bundle size
will not be significant.

# Flex Container
## Overview

The Flex container `::: flex` provides a convenient way to apply Flexbox layout to block-level content in markdown.

## Usage

```md
::: flex [center|between|around] [start|center|end] [gap="20"] [column]

<!-- Block content 1 -->

<!-- Block content 2 -->

:::
```

## Attributes

* On the main axis, use `center` / `between` / `around` to specify alignment;
* On the cross axis, use `start` / `center` / `end` to specify alignment;
* Use `gap="20"` to specify spacing;
* Use `column` to set the main axis direction to vertical.

## Examples

### Centered Table Alignment

**Input:**

```md
::: flex center

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1        | 2        | 3        |
| 4        | 5        | 6        |

# Icons
## Overview

The theme supports icons from the following sources in Markdown files:

* [iconify](https://iconify.design/) - Supported by default
* [iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/) - Optional
* [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Optional

The theme provides Markdown syntax support for icons, offering a simple and flexible way to insert icons in Markdown.

[The theme also provides `<Icon />` component support. Click to learn more](../components/icon.md){.read-more}

## Syntax

Icon syntax is inline syntax and can be mixed with other Markdown syntax within paragraphs.

**Basic Syntax**: Use `::` to wrap the icon name:

```md
::name::
```

**Setting Icon Size and Color**: (Note: Spaces are required)

```md
::name =size::
::name /color::
::name =size /color::
```

* `=size`: Set icon size
  * `=16`: Icon width and height are `16px`
  * `=24x16`: Icon width is `24px`, height is `16px`
  * `=x16`: Icon height is `16px`, width is auto
  * `=1.2em`: Icon width and height are `1.2em`
  * `=1.2emx1.5em`: Icon width is `1.2em`, height is `1.5em`

* `/color`: Set icon color, supports `hex`/`rgb`/`rgba`/`hsl`/`hsla` and other valid color values
  * `/#fff`: Icon color is `#fff`
  * `/rgb(255,0,0)`: Icon color is `rgb(255,0,0)`

## Iconify

[iconify](https://iconify.design/) provides support for **200K+** open source icons, sufficient for most project needs.
The theme uses **iconify** as the default icon source.

Use the `::collect:name` syntax in Markdown to insert icons.

### Configuration

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: { // [!code ++:3]
      icon: { provider: 'iconify' } // Supported by default
    }
  })
})
```

```ts
interface IconOptions {
  provider: 'iconify'
  prefix?: string
}
```

### Usage

::: steps

* Search for the desired icon at [iconify search](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) and copy the icon name:

  ![iconify](/images/icon/iconify-1.png)

* Use the `::collect:name` syntax in Markdown to insert the icon

  ```md
  ::carbon:home::
  ```

  **Output:** ::carbon:home::

:::

In Iconify, icons are organized into different `collect`s, each containing several icons.
In the `::collect:name` syntax, use `:` to separate `collect` and `name`.

If you primarily use icons from a specific `collect`, you can specify `prefix` in the configuration
to omit the `collect` prefix in the `::collect:name` syntax:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      icon: {
        provider: 'iconify',
        prefix: 'carbon', // Use `carbon` icon collection by default // [!code ++]
      }
    }
  })
})
```

```md
::home::    <!-- Uses `carbon` icon collection by default, auto-completes to `carbon:home` -->
::solar:user-bold::  <!-- Explicitly use other icon collections -->
```

**Output:** ::carbon:home:: ::solar:user-bold::

### Installation

For enterprise internal projects or situations where external network resources cannot be accessed,
the theme recommends installing the `@iconify/json` dependency.

The theme automatically parses icon data from `@iconify/json` and packages used icons as local resources.

::: npm-to

```sh
npm install @iconify/json
```

:::

### Examples

Input:

```md
github: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled::
Change color: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled /#f00::
Change size: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled =36px::
Change size and color: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled =36px /#f00::

Colorful icon ::skill-icons:vscode-dark =36px::
```

Output:

github: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled::
Change color: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled /#f00::
Change size: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled =36px::
Change size and color: ::tdesign:logo-github-filled =36px /#f00::

Colorful icon ::skill-icons:vscode-dark =36px::

## Iconfont

[iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/) provides massive icon support.

### Configuration

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: { // [!code ++:3]
      icon: {
        provider: 'iconfont',
        assets: 'https://at.alicdn.com/t/c/xxxx.css' // Example URL
      }
    }
  })
})
```

```ts
interface IconOptions {
  provider: 'iconfont'
  /**
   * Icon prefix
   * @default 'iconfont icon-'
   */
  prefix?: string

  /**
   * iconfont resource URL
   */
  assets: string | string[]
}
```

### Usage

[Go to **iconfont Help Center** to learn about **Creating Projects** and **Adding Icons**](https://www.iconfont.cn/help/detail){.read-more}

:::steps

* Get the project resource URL from iconfont, copy and paste it into the `assets` configuration:

  ![iconfont assets](/images/icon/iconfont-1.png)

  ```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      markdown: {
        icon: {
          provider: 'iconfont',
          assets: 'https://at.alicdn.com/t/c/xxxx.css' // Example URL // [!code ++]
        }
      }
    })
  })
  ```

  You can also choose to download it locally, store the resources in the `.vuepress/public` directory,
  and then fill in the local file path in the `assets` configuration.

* Check the iconfont project configuration to get the `prefix` configuration:

  ![iconfont prefix](/images/icon/iconfont-2.png)

  The `prefix` configuration consists of `font family` and `font class` prefix. If the iconfont project uses default settings,
  then `prefix` is `iconfont icon-`, in which case you can skip this step.

  ```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
  export default defineUserConfig({
    theme: plumeTheme({
      markdown: {
        icon: {
          provider: 'iconfont',
          prefix: 'iconfont icon-', // Default value  // [!code ++]
        }
      }
    })
  })
  ```

* Use the `::name::` syntax in Markdown to insert icons:

  ![iconfont name](/images/icon/iconfont-3.png)

  Fill the `font class` from the image into the `::name::` syntax:

  ```md
  ::hot::
  ::hot =24px::
  ::hot =24px /#f00::
  ```

  Output:

## Fontawesome

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provides both free and paid icon support. Paid icons require a subscription.

[View **Fontawesome** official documentation](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/setup/get-started){.read-more}

### Configuration

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: { // [!code ++:3]
      icon: {
        provider: 'fontawesome',
        assets: 'fontawesome' // Preset resource URL, loaded from CDN
      }
    }
  })
})
```

```ts
interface IconOptions {
  provider: 'fontawesome'
  /**
   * Icon prefix
   * @default 'fas'
   */
  prefix?: FontAwesomePrefix
  /**
   * iconfont resource URL
   */
  assets: (FontAwesomeAssetBuiltin | string)[]
}

type FontAwesomeAssetBuiltin = 'fontawesome' | 'fontawesome-with-brands'

type FontAwesomePrefix
  = | 'fas' | 's' // fa-solid fa-name
    | 'far' | 'r' // fa-regular fa-name
    | 'fal' | 'l' // fa-light fa-name
    | 'fat' | 't' // fa-thin fa-name
    | 'fads' | 'ds' // fa-duotone fa-solid fa-name
    | 'fass' | 'ss' // fa-sharp fa-solid fa-name
    | 'fasr' | 'sr' // fa-sharp fa-regular fa-name
    | 'fasl' | 'sl' // fa-sharp fa-light fa-name
    | 'fast' | 'st' // fa-sharp fa-thin fa-name
    | 'fasds' | 'sds' // fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-name
    | 'fab' | 'b' // fa-brands fa-name
```

[In **Fontawesome**, icons are controlled by families + styles. **View details**](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/add-icons/how-to#setting-different-families--styles){.read-more}

For easier management, you can use the `::prefix:name::` syntax to set families + styles through the prefix.
The default prefix is `fas`, which can be omitted:

```md
::name:: <!-- prefix = fas -->
::fas:name:: <!-- prefix = fas -->
::s:name:: <!-- prefix = fas, s is shorthand for fas -->
```

You can modify the default prefix by configuring `markdown.icon.prefix`.

::: tip
Fontawesome's free icons only support `solid`, some `regular`, and `brands`.
For the free version, prefixes only support `fas` / `far` / `fab` and their shorthand prefixes.
:::

### Usage

[Go to **https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=free** to search for free icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=free){.read-more}

:::steps

* Copy the icon name:

  ![fontawesome name](/images/icon/fontawesome-1.png)

* Use the `::prefix:name::` syntax in Markdown to insert the icon:

  ```md
  ::circle-user:: <!-- prefix = fas -->
  ::fas:circle-user:: <!-- prefix = fas -->
  ::s:circle-user:: <!-- prefix = fas, s is shorthand for fas -->
  ```

:::

### Examples

```md
::circle-user::
::circle-user =24px::
::circle-user =24px /#f00::
```

Output:

[Add more style support for Fontawesome](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/style/styling){.read-more}

```
::circle-user 2xl::  <!-- 2xl is shorthand for fa-2xl, icon size is 2em -->
::circle-user rotate-90:: <!-- icon rotated 90 degrees -->
::circle-user beat:: <!-- icon animation -->
::circle-user border:: <!-- icon border -->
::circle-user 2xl beat:: <!-- mixed styles -->
```

Output:

## Additional Notes

When `markdown.icon.provider` is set to a value other than `iconify`, `iconify` remains supported by default,
and you can still insert iconify icons in Markdown:

In the `::collect:name::` syntax, add `iconify` at the beginning:

```md /iconify /
::iconify carbon:home::
```

Output:

::iconify carbon:home::

## Overview

The theme supports including file snippets in Markdown files.

File inclusion is enabled by default, and you can customize its behavior through configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      include: { // [!code ++:3]
        // ... options
      },
    }
  })
})
```

## Syntax

Use `<!-- @include: filename -->` to include a file.

To include specific parts of a file, you can specify line ranges:

* `<!-- @include: filename{start-end} -->`
* `<!-- @include: filename{start-} -->`
* `<!-- @include: filename{-end} -->`

You can also include file regions:

* `<!-- @include: filename#region -->`

::::tip File Regions
File regions are a concept from VSCode, where region content is surrounded by `#region` and `#endregion` comments.

  }
  std::cout << f();
  return 0;
}
```

:::

::::

## Configuration

You can also configure an object to customize the file path resolution and inclusion behavior.

```ts
interface IncludeOptions {
  /**
   * Handler for resolving include file paths
   *
   * @default (path) => path
   */
  resolvePath?: (path: string, cwd: string | null) => string
  /**
   * Whether to deeply include nested Markdown files
   *
   * @default false
   */
  deep?: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to use `<!-- @include: xxx -->` instead of `@include: xxx` for file inclusion
   *
   * @default true
   */
  useComment?: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to resolve relative image paths in included Markdown files
   *
   * @default true
   */
  resolveImagePath?: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to resolve relative file paths in included Markdown files
   *
   * @default true
   */
  resolveLinkPath?: boolean
}
```

For example: You can use `@src` as an alias for your source directory.

```ts{5-11} title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      include: {
        resolvePath: (file) => {
          if (file.startsWith('@src'))
            return file.replace('@src', path.resolve(__dirname, '..'))

          return file
        },
      },
    }
  })
})
```

Additionally, if you want to place Markdown files directly alongside your actual files but don't
want them rendered as pages, you can set the `pagePatterns` option in your VuePress configuration.
For more details, refer to [pagePatterns](https://vuejs.press/zh/reference/config.html#pagepatterns).

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  // Now any file with `.snippet.md` extension will not be rendered as a page
  pagePatterns: ['**/*.md', '!**/*.snippet.md', '!.vuepress', '!node_modules'], // [!code ++]
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      include: true
    }
  })
})
```

## Examples

Given a `foo.snippet.md` file in your project:
:::: code-tabs
@tab foo.snippet.md

```md
### Level 3 Heading

This is content from the foo.snippet.md file.

::: info
Content included in an info container.
:::

<!-- region snippet -->
This is content wrapped by `<!-- region snippet -->`.

Included via `<!-- @include: ./foo.snippet.md#snippet -->`.
<!-- endregion snippet -->
```

::::

Using `<!-- @include: ./foo.snippet.md -->` to include the entire file:

:::: window title="Include by file"

### Level 3 Heading

# Mark
## Overview

The ==marker pen== feature extends Markdown's `==Mark==` syntax, allowing text to be marked with various colors and customizable options.

## Syntax

### Basic Usage

Use `== ==` to mark text. Note the spaces around the equals signs.

**Input:**

```md
vuepress-theme-plume is a ==simple and beautiful== theme
```

**Output:**

vuepress-theme-plume is a ==simple and beautiful== theme

### Color Customization

Different marker pen colors are set using [Markdown attribute syntax](./extensions.md#attribute-support).

Add `{.classname}` immediately after the `==Mark==` syntax to customize colors.

**Input:**

```md
==a tip=={.tip} ==a warning=={.warning} ==an error=={.danger} ==important content=={.important}
```

**Output:**

\==a tip=={.tip} ==a warning=={.warning} ==an error=={.danger} ==important content=={.important}

## Built-in Color Schemes

The theme includes these predefined schemes:

* **default**: `==Default==` - ==Default==
* **info**: `==Info=={.info}` - ==Info=={.info}
* **note**: `==Note=={.note}` - ==Note=={.note}
* **tip**: `==Tip=={.tip}` - ==Tip=={.tip}
* **warning**: `==Warning=={.warning}` - ==Warning=={.warning}
* **danger**: `==Danger=={.danger}` - ==Danger=={.danger}
* **caution**: `==Caution=={.caution}` - ==Caution=={.caution}
* **important**: `==Important=={.important}` - ==Important=={.important}

## Custom Color Schemes

Marker pen can be customized via [custom styles](../custom/style.md).

You can fully customize highlighter colors, including modifying built-in schemes.

Within the theme, markers are set using the combination of `class name` and `CSS variables`.

The following are `CSS variables` related to markers:

* `--vp-mark-text` - Text color of marker pen
* `--vp-mark-bg` - Background color of marker pen
* `--vp-mark-linear-color` - gradient color, only used in the built-in `--vp-mark-bg-image`
* `--vp-mark-bg-shift` - Built in gradient background offset of marker pen
* `--vp-mark-bg-image` - Background image of marker pen

### Modifying Built-in Schemes

Copy these built-in configurations to your [style file](../custom/style.md#style-file) for modification:

```css :collapsed-lines
mark {
  --vp-mark-text: currentcolor;
  --vp-mark-bg: transparent;
  --vp-mark-bg-shift: 0.55lh;
  --vp-mark-linear-color: var(--vp-c-brand-3);
  --vp-mark-bg-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--vp-mark-linear-color) 50%, transparent 50%);
  animation: var(--vp-mark-animation, mark-highlight 1.5s 0.5s forwards);
}

[data-mark-mode="lazy"] mark {
  --vp-mark-animation: none;
}

[data-mark-mode="lazy"] mark.vp-mark-visible {
  animation: mark-highlight 1.5s 0.2s forwards;
}

mark.note {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #ff0;
}

mark.info {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: var(--vp-c-default-1);
}

mark.tip {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #39ff14;
}

mark.warning {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #fc0;
}

mark.caution, mark.danger {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #f99;
}

mark.important {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #ccf;
}

[data-theme="dark"] mark.note {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #660;
}

[data-theme="dark"] mark.tip {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #063;
}

[data-theme="dark"] mark.warning {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #c60;
}

[data-theme="dark"] mark.caution,
[data-theme="dark"] mark.danger {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #c66;
}

[data-theme="dark"] mark.important {
  --vp-mark-linear-color: #66c;
}
```

### Adding New Schemes

Add new color schemes in your [style file](../custom/style.md#style-file) using this format:

```css
mark.classname {
  --vp-mark-text: marktext;  /* Text color */
  --vp-mark-bg-image: none;  /* Background image */
  --vp-mark-bg: mark;        /* Background color */
  --vp-mark-linear-color: mark;  /* Gradient color */
}
```

Use `==Mark=={.classname}` in Markdown.

You can name `classname` freely and add other CSS properties besides modifying CSS variables.

## Animation Modes

By default, the highlight animation plays as soon as the page renders.

If you prefer to animate only when the marker enters the viewport, set `markdown.mark` to `'lazy'` in your theme config:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" {5}
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      mark: 'lazy',
    },
  }),
})
```

# Mathematical Formulas
## Overview

The theme has built-in support for mathematical formulas.

This feature is powered by [@vuepress/plugin-markdown-math](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/markdown/markdown-math.html).
You can choose to render mathematical formulas in markdown using the following methods:

* `katex` (default)
* `mathjax`

## Usage

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      math: {
        type: 'katex', // 'katex' | 'mathjax'
        // ... Other configuration options
      }
    },
  })
})
```

When you choose to use `mathjax`, you also need to install the dependency by running the following command:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i @mathjax/src
```

:::

## Syntax

### Inline Syntax

Use `$` to wrap mathematical formulas *(i.e., write the mathematical formula between two `$` symbols)*

::: demo markdown title="Inline Mode" expanded

```md
Euler's identity $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ is a beautiful formula in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
```

:::

### Block Syntax

Use `$$` to wrap mathematical formulas *(i.e., write the mathematical formula between two `$$` symbols)*

```md /$$/
<!-- Write the mathematical formula between two `$$` symbols, rendered in a separate block -->
$$xxx$$

<!-- The two `$$` symbols can each occupy a separate line, with the mathematical formula between them -->
$$
xxx
$$
```

:::demo markdown title="Block Mode" expanded

```md
$$
\frac {\partial^r} {\partial \omega^r} \left(\frac {y^{\omega}} {\omega}\right)
= \left(\frac {y^{\omega}} {\omega}\right) \left\{(\log y)^r + \sum_{i=1}^r \frac {(-1)^ Ir \cdots (r-i+1) (\log y)^{ri}} {\omega^i} \right\}
$$
```

# npmTo Container
## Overview

The npmTo container converts npm command-line code blocks into `pnpm / yarn / deno / bun` command-line
code blocks, presenting them as a group of code blocks on the page.

Within the `::: npm-to` container, you only need to write the npm command code block once.

::: details Why do we need the npmTo container?
When I write documentation, I often need to provide commands for different environments like `pnpm / yarn / npm`.
This requires multiple code blocks wrapped in the `::: code-tabs` container,
which is time-consuming and takes up a lot of space in the Markdown content,
leading to a poor experience. That's why I created the `::: npm-to` container to solve this problem.
:::

## Usage

````md{1,5}
::: npm-to
``` sh
npm install -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```
:::
````

Just wrap the code block containing the `npm` command-line in the `::: npm-to` container.

::: warning The npm-to container only supports a single code block and cannot contain other content
:::

The code above will be converted internally to:

````md
::: code-tabs
@tab pnpm
``` sh
pnpm add -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```
@tab yarn
``` sh
yarn add -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```
@tab npm
``` sh
npm install -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```
:::
````

The final output on the page will be:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm install -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```

:::

You can also control the display order of the code blocks in the group, as shown below:

**Input:**

````md {1,5}
::: npm-to tabs="npm,yarn,pnpm,bun,deno"
``` sh
npm install -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: npm-to tabs="npm,yarn,pnpm,bun,deno"

```sh
npm install -D vuepress vuepress-theme-plume
```

:::

## Configuration

This feature is not enabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      // npmTo: true, // Enable with default configuration
      npmTo: {
        tabs: ['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm'], // Default display order of code blocks
      }
    },
  })
})
```

`npm-to` supports converting `npm` command lines to `pnpm / yarn / deno / bun` command lines.
You can configure the `tabs` according to your needs.

## Supported Command Lines

`npmTo` does not support all `npm` command lines. Here is the list of supported commands:

* `npm install` / `npm i`
* `npm run` / `npm run-script`
* `npm init`
* `npm create`
* `npm uninstall` / `npm rm` / `npm remove` / `npm un` / `npm unlink`
* `npm ci`
* `npx`

::: info
For unsupported command lines, `npmTo` will not process them and will only copy them to the other code blocks.
:::

## Examples

**Input:**

````md
::: npm-to
```sh
npm install && npm run docs:dev
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: npm-to

```sh
npm install && npm run docs:dev
```

:::

**Input:**

````md
::: npm-to
```sh
npm i -D vue
npm i --save-peer vuepress
npm i typescript
```
:::
````

**Output:**
::: npm-to

```sh
npm i -D vue
npm i --save-peer vuepress
npm i typescript
```

:::

**Input:**

````md
::: npm-to
```sh
npm run docs:dev -- --clean-cache
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: npm-to

```sh
npm run docs:dev -- --clean-cache
```

:::

**Input:**

````md
::: npm-to tabs="pnpm,yarn,npm,bun,deno"
```sh
npm ci
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: npm-to tabs="pnpm,yarn,npm,bun,deno"

```sh
npm ci
```

# Plot Text
## Overview

Sometimes, you may not want to display text content completely unreservedly, preferring to maintain some secrecy.
This could be to pique readers' curiosity or simply to add a bit of reading difficulty, making the article more interesting.

To satisfy this playful intention, the theme provides a fun little feature called **"plot" text**. It looks like this:

:::window
Did you know that !!Lu Xun!! once said: "!!I never said this!!!" It was an enlightening revelation that deeply
inspired me, filling me with unparalleled strength! So, !!I turned over in bed!!!
:::

Readers cannot directly read the complete content - parts of it are "covered up" and require hovering the
mouse over the content to see what's hidden.

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      plot: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

`markdownPower.plot` accepts either `boolean | PlotOptions` type, which controls the default behavior of this feature.

```ts
interface PlotOptions {
  /**
   * Trigger method
   *
   * @default 'hover'
   */
  trigger?: 'hover' | 'click'

  /**
   * Mask layer effect
   *
   * @default 'mask'
   */
  effect?: 'mask' | 'blur'
}
```

## Syntax

```md
!!hidden content!!
```

You can also control behavior through attribute syntax:

```md
!!hidden content!!{.click}
!!hidden content!!{.hover}

!!hidden content!!{.mask}
!!hidden content!!{.blur}

!!hidden content!!{.blur .click}
```

* `.click` - Trigger on click
* `.hover` - Trigger on mouse hover
* `.mask` - Mask layer effect
* `.blur` - Text blur effect

::: info You can also use the [`<Plot />`](../components/plot.md) component as an alternative.
:::

## Frontmatter

Use the `plot` option in Frontmatter to control the default behavior of this feature on the current page:

```
---
plot:
  trigger: hover
  effect: blur
---
```

## Examples

**Input**:

```md
Did you know that !!Lu Xun!! once said: "!!I never said this!!!" It was an enlightening revelation that deeply inspired me, filling me with unparalleled strength! So, !!I turned over in bed!!!!
```

**Output**:

:::window
Did you know that !!Lu Xun!! once said: "!!I never said this!!!" It was an enlightening revelation that
deeply inspired me, filling me with unparalleled strength! So, !!I turned over in bed!!!!
:::

**Input**:

```md
Mask effect + hover: !!Hover to see me!!{.mask .hover}
Mask effect + click: !!Click to see me!!{.mask .click}
Blur effect + hover: !!Hover to see me!!{.blur .hover}
Blur effect + click: !!Click to see me!!{.blur .click}
```

**Output**:

:::window
Mask effect + hover: !!Hover to see me!!{.mask .hover}

Mask effect + click: !!Click to see me!!{.mask .click}

Blur effect + hover: !!Hover to see me!!{.blur .hover}

Blur effect + click: !!Click to see me!!{.blur .click}

# QR Code
@[qrcode](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume)

## Overview

In Markdown, you can embed QR code images generated from text using simple syntax, allowing them to be scanned when needed.

The text can be:

* A remotely accessible link address
* A path to a `.md` file within the VuePress site *(both absolute and relative paths are supported)*
* Any plain text *(avoid overly long text)*

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      qrcode: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Syntax

### Inline Syntax

Inline syntax is suitable for shorter `text`, such as links.

```md
<!-- Basic Syntax -->
@[qrcode](text)
<!-- With Attributes -->
@[qrcode card svg title="xxx" align="center"](text)
```

### Container Syntax

Container syntax is suitable for longer `text`, such as paragraphs or multi-line text.

```md
::: qrcode card svg title="xxx" align="center"
text
:::
```

::: warning QR codes generated from overly long text may be truncated and potentially unscannable.
:::

## Attributes

:::: field-group
::: field name="card" type="boolean" optional default="false"
Whether to enable the card style.
:::
::: field name="svg" type="boolean" optional default="false"
Whether to render the QR code in SVG format. The default format is PNG.
:::
::: field name="title" type="string" optional
The title of the QR code.
:::
::: field name="align" type="'left' | 'center' | 'right'" optional default="left"
The alignment of the QR code.
:::
::: field name="width" type="number" optional default="300"
The width of the QR code.
:::
::::

The following attribute configurations directly affect the final rendering of the QR code.
Usually, the default values are sufficient and do not require configuration.

:::: field-group
::: field name="light" type="string" optional default="#ffffffff"
The color for the light parts of the QR code, i.e., the background color.
:::
::: field name="dark" type="string" optional default="#000000ff"
The color for the dark parts of the QR code, i.e., the QR code color.
:::
::: field name="margin" type="number" optional default="2"
The margin of the QR code.
:::
::: field name="level" type="'L' | 'M' | 'Q' | 'H'" optional default="M"
**Error Correction Level**

Error correction allows the QR code to be successfully scanned even if it is dirty or damaged.
Four levels are available depending on the operating environment.

Higher levels provide better error resistance but reduce the data capacity of the symbol.

If the QR code symbol is unlikely to be damaged, lower error correction levels like Low or Medium can be safely used.
:::
::: field name="version" type="number" optional
**QR Code Version**

If not specified, a more suitable value will be automatically calculated. Valid range: `1-40`.
:::
::: field name="scale" type="number" optional default="4"
Scaling factor. A value of 1 means 1 pixel per module (black dot).
:::
::: field name="mask" type="1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7" optional
The mask pattern used to mask the symbol.

If not specified, a more suitable value will be automatically calculated.
::::

## Examples

### Accessible Remote Link

**Input:**

```md
@[qrcode](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume)
```

**Output:**

@[qrcode](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume)

@[qrcode](vuepress-theme-plume is an open-source VuePress theme)
```

**Output:**

@\[qrcode]\(vuepress-theme-plume is an open-source VuePress theme)

**Input:**

```md
::: qrcode title="The Road Not Taken · by Robert Frost"
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
:::

# Steps
## Overview

When you need to present content as sequential steps, you can use the `steps` container to achieve this.

## Syntax

Within the `steps` container, use ordered lists (or unordered lists) to represent steps. You can use any Markdown syntax inside the container.

```md
::: steps

1. Step 1

  Related content

2. Step 2

  Related content

:::
```

## Examples

Input:

````md
:::: steps
1. Step 1

   ```ts
   console.log('Hello World!')
   ```

2. Step 2

   This is the related content for step 2

3. Step 3

# Table Enhancement
## Overview

The default table functionality in Markdown is relatively basic.
However, in practical usage scenarios, it is often necessary to add additional information to tables,
such as a table title, or extra features like the ability to copy table content.

Without breaking the table syntax, the theme provides a `::: table` container to conveniently extend table capabilities.

::: tip The table enhancement container is under continuous development.
If you have suggestions for other features, please provide feedback via an [Issue](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/issues).
:::

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in your `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      // table: true, // Enable default features
      table: {
        // Default table alignment: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'
        align: 'left',
        // Whether the table width is the max-content width
        // Inline elements will not wrap automatically; a scrollbar is displayed when the content exceeds the container width.
        maxContent: false,
        // The table width defaults to occupying the entire row.
        fullWidth: false,
        /**
         * Copy as HTML/Markdown
         * `true` is equivalent to `'all'`, enabling both HTML and Markdown copying.
         */
        copy: true, // true | 'all' | 'html' | 'md'
      }
    },
  })
})
```

## Syntax

Simply wrap the table within a `:::table` block.

```md
:::table title="Title" align="center" max-content copy="all"
| xx | xx | xx |
| -- | -- | -- |
| xx | xx | xx |
:::
```

### Props

:::: field-group

:::

::: field name="align" type="'left' | 'center' | 'right'" optional default="'left'"
Table alignment.
:::

::: field name="copy" type="boolean | 'all' | 'html' | 'md'" optional default="true"
Displays a copy button in the top-right corner of the table for copying as HTML or Markdown.

* `true` is equivalent to `'all'`.
* `false` hides the copy button.
* `'all'` enables both `'html'` and `'md'` copying.
* `'html'` enables copying as HTML.
* `'md'` enables copying as Markdown.
  :::

::: field name="maxContent" type="boolean" optional default="false"
Inline elements will not wrap automatically; a scrollbar is displayed when the content exceeds the container width.
:::

::: field name="fullWidth" type="boolean" optional default="false"
The table width defaults to occupying the entire row.
:::

::: field name="hl-rows" type="string" optional

:::

## Custom Highlight Types

In [Custom CSS Styles](../custom/style.md), custom highlight types can be defined using the following format:

```css
.vp-table table th.type,
.vp-table table td.type {
  color: #000;
  background-color: #fff;
}
```

For example, to add a `blue` highlight type:

```css
.vp-table table th.blue,
.vp-table table td.blue {
  color: #4a7cb9;
  background-color: #a3c6e5;
}
```

This custom type can then be used in tables:

```md
::: table hl-rows="blue:1" hl-cols="blue:1" hl-cells="blue:(3,3)"
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
:::
```

::: table hl-rows="blue:1" hl-cols="blue:1" hl-cells="blue:(3,3)"

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

:::

## Table Cell Merging

Table cell merging is implemented through the attribute syntax supported by [markdown-it-attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs).
Therefore, it does not need to be used within the `:::table` container; you can use it in any table.

Inside a table cell, add `rowspan=rows` or `colspan=cols` (or a combination) using
the attribute syntax `{}` at the end of the cell content to achieve table cell merging.

**Input:**

```md
| A                       | B   | C   | D                |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | ---------------- |
| 1                       | 11  | 111 | 1111 {rowspan=3} |
| 2 {colspan=2 rowspan=2} | 22  | 222 | 2222             |
| 3                       | 33  | 333 | 3333             |
```

**Output:**

| A                       | B   | C   | D                |
| ----------------------- | --- | --- | ---------------- |
| 1                       | 11  | 111 | 1111 {rowspan=3} |
| 2 {colspan=2 rowspan=2} | 22  | 222 | 2222             |
| 3                       | 33  | 333 | 3333             |

# Tab Groups
## Overview

Add support for tabs in Markdown.

## Syntax

You need to wrap tabs in a `tabs` container.

You can add an id suffix to the `tabs` container, which will be used as the tab id.
All tabs with the same id will share the same toggle event.

```md
::: tabs#fruit

<!-- Here, 'fruit' will be used as the id. This is optional. -->

<!-- Tab content -->

:::
```

Inside this container, you should use the `@tab` marker to label and separate tab content.

After the `@tab` marker, you can add the text `:active` to make a tab active by default. The text following this will be parsed as the tab title.

```md
::: tabs

@tab Title 1

<!-- Tab 1 content -->

@tab Title 2

<!-- Tab 2 content -->

@tab:active Title 3

<!-- Tab 3 will be active by default -->

<!-- Tab 3 content -->

:::
```

By default, the title is used as the value of the tab, but you can override this using an id suffix.

```md
::: tabs

@tab Title 1

<!-- Here, the title "Title 1" of Tab 1 will be used as its value. -->

<!-- Tab 1 content -->

@tab Title 2#value2

<!-- Here, the title of Tab 2 will be "Title 2", but it will use "value2" as the tab's value -->

<!-- Tab 2 content -->

:::
```

You can use Vue syntax and components within each tab, and you have access to `value` and `isActive`,
which represent the bound value of the tab and whether the tab is currently active.

## Example

**Input:**

````
::: tabs
@tab npm

npm should be installed alongside Node.js.

@tab pnpm

```sh
corepack enable
corepack use pnpm@8
```

:::
````

**Output:**

::: tabs
@tab npm

npm should be installed alongside Node.js.

@tab pnpm

```sh
corepack enable
corepack use pnpm@8
```

# Timeline
## Overview

In markdown, use the `::: timeline` container with markdown unordered list syntax to achieve ==timeline== rendering effects.

* Supports ==horizontal== and ==vertical== orientations
* Vertical orientation supports **left alignment**, **right alignment**, and **justified alignment**
* Supports **icons** and **line styles**
* Supports setting **colors** through preset **types**, and supports custom colors

## Enable

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the `theme` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      timeline: true, // [!code ++]
    }
  })
})
```

## Usage

Inside the `::: timeline` container, use markdown unordered list syntax. Each list item represents a point on the timeline.

```md{1,9} title="timeline.md"
::: timeline Configuration
- Title
  Configuration

  Content

- Title
  Configuration

  Content
:::
```

For each list item:

* Everything from the **first line** to the **first empty line** is considered the **title**.
  The line immediately following the title is used to **configure** the behavior of the current item.

* **After the first empty line**: Content

:::important Please ensure correct indentation
:::

**A simple example:**

**Input:**

```md
::: timeline
- Node 1
  time=2025-03-20 type=success

  Content

- Node 2
  time=2025-02-21 type=warning

  Content

- Node 3
  time=2025-01-22 type=danger

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: timeline

* Node 1
  time=2025-03-20 type=success

  Content

* Node 2
  time=2025-02-21 type=warning

  Content

* Node 3
  time=2025-01-22 type=danger

  Content
  :::

::: important Timeline defaults to vertical orientation
:::

## Configuration

**Timeline** supports highly flexible configuration options, divided into two main parts:

* **Container Configuration**: Configuration on the `::: timeline` container, placed after `::: timeline`. For example:

  `::: timeline horizontal` renders a horizontally oriented timeline.

* **List Item Configuration**: Configuration for each list item, placed on a separate line immediately following the title. For example:

  ```md
  ::: timeline
  - Title                          <!--Title line-->
    Also title                     <!--Title line-->
    time=2025-03-20 type=success  <!--Configuration line (optional)-->
                                  <!--Empty line (required if content exists)-->
    Content
  :::
  ```

### Container Configuration

  Content

* Node 4
  time=2025-01-22 type=important card=true icon="mdi:cake-variant-outline"

  Content
  :::

### Card Nodes

Card nodes can be flexibly controlled:

* Add `card` in container configuration to make every list item a card node.
* Add `card=true` in list item configuration to set the node as a card node.
* Add `card=false` in list item configuration to set the node as a non-card node.

Card node styles are affected by the `type` configuration.

::: tip Adding `card=true` / `card=false` in list item configuration can override the container's `card` configuration
:::

**Input:**

```md{1} /card=false/
::: timeline card
- Node 1
  time=2025-03-20

  Content

- Node 2
  time=2025-04-20 type=success card=false

  Content

- Node 3
  time=2025-01-22 type=danger

  Content

- Node 4
  time=2025-01-22 type=important

  Content
:::
```

**Output:**

::: timeline card

* Node 1
  time=2025-03-20

  Content

* Node 2
  time=2025-04-20 type=success card=false

  Content

* Node 3
  time=2025-01-22 type=danger

  Content

* Node 4
  time=2025-01-22 type=important

  Content
  :::

## Custom Node Types

Timeline node types are controlled through CSS Variables. The theme provides the following CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --vp-timeline-c-line: var(--vp-c-border);   /* Line color */
  --vp-timeline-c-point: var(--vp-c-border);  /* Point color */
  --vp-timeline-c-title: var(--vp-c-text-1);  /* Title text color */
  --vp-timeline-c-text: var(--vp-c-text-1);   /* Content text color */
  --vp-timeline-c-time: var(--vp-c-text-3);   /* Time text color */
  --vp-timeline-c-icon: var(--vp-c-bg);       /* Icon color */
  --vp-timeline-bg-card: var(--vp-c-bg-soft); /* Background color for card nodes */
}
```

For example, the built-in node type `tip`:

```css /.tip/
.vp-timeline-item.tip {
  --vp-timeline-c-line: var(--vp-c-tip-1);
  --vp-timeline-c-point: var(--vp-c-tip-1);
  --vp-timeline-bg-card: var(--vp-c-tip-soft);
}
```

You can override built-in types or add new types in [Custom Styles](../custom/style.md).

**Example:**

```css title=".vuepress/styles/index.css"
.vp-timeline-item.your-type {
  --vp-timeline-c-line: #3cf;
  --vp-timeline-c-point: #3cf;
  --vp-timeline-bg-card: rgba(60, 252, 255, 0.314);
}
```

```md /type=your-type/
::: timeline
- Node 1
  time=2025-03-20

  Content

- Node 2
  time=2025-04-20 type=your-type card=true

  Content

- Node 3
  time=2025-01-22 type=danger

  Content
:::
```

::: timeline

* Node 1
  time=2025-03-20

  Content

* Node 2
  time=2025-04-20 type=your-type card=true

  Content

* Node 3
  time=2025-01-22 type=danger

# Two Slash
## Overview

Adds support for [TypeScript TwoSlash](https://www.typescriptlang.org/dev/twoslash/) in code blocks. Provides inline type hints within code blocks.

This feature is powered by [shiki](https://shiki.style/) and [@shikijs/twoslash](https://shiki.style/packages/twoslash), and integrated in [@vuepress-plume/plugin-shikiji](https://github.com/pengzhanbo/vuepress-theme-plume/tree/main/plugins/plugin-shikiji).

::: important **twoslash** is an advanced feature that requires proficiency in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and understanding of [twoslash syntax](https://twoslash.netlify.app/).
:::

::: warning
`twoslash` is a relatively time-consuming feature. Since it requires type compilation of code,
if the code imports large packages, it can take considerable time.

Specifically, since VuePress pre-compiles all markdown files on startup, this directly affects VuePress startup time.
If you include many `twoslash` code blocks, this may significantly increase VuePress startup time.

For example, without `twoslash`, VuePress startup time typically ranges from `300ms ~ 1000ms`.
With `twoslash`, compiling a single `twoslash` code block may require an additional `500ms` or more.

However, don't worry about compilation time during markdown file hot updates.
The theme optimizes code highlighting compilation time - even if a single markdown file contains
multiple code blocks, the theme only compiles **modified code blocks**, so hot updates remain fast.
:::

[twoslash](https://twoslash.netlify.app/) is a `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` markup language.
You can write code examples that describe entire `JavaScript` projects.

`twoslash` treats **double-slash comments** (`//`) as preprocessor directives for code examples.

`twoslash` uses the same compiler APIs as text editors to provide type-driven hover information, accurate errors, and type annotations.

## Feature Preview

Hover over **variables** or **functions** to see the effect:

```ts twoslash
import { createHighlighter } from 'shiki'

const highlighter = await createHighlighter({ themes: ['nord'], langs: ['javascript'] })
//      ^?
//

// @log: Custom log message
const a = 1
// @error: Custom error message
const b = 1
// @warn: Custom warning message
const c = 1
// @annotate: Custom annotation message
```

## Configuration

### Enabling the Feature

Before enabling this feature, you need to install the `@vuepress/shiki-twoslash` package:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i @vuepress/shiki-twoslash
```

:::

Enable the `twoslash` option in the theme configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    codeHighlighter: {
      twoslash: true,
    },
  }),
})
```

::: important
For most users, `twoslash` is not a necessary feature, and `twoslash`-related dependencies have large
package sizes. Therefore, all `twoslash` implementations have been moved to `@vuepress/shiki-twoslash`,
which effectively reduces the initial installation size of the theme.

You only need to install `@vuepress/shiki-twoslash` when you require the `twoslash` feature.
:::

### Importing Type Files from `node_modules`

The main feature of **twoslash** is type compilation of code blocks, which natively supports importing type files from your project's `node_modules`.

For example, if you need type hints for `express`, you need to install the `@types/express` dependency in your project:

::: npm-to

```sh
npm i -D @types/express
```

:::

Then, you can use `express` types in code blocks as follows:

````md
```ts twoslash
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
```
````

### Importing Local Type Files

For importing local type files, since it's difficult to determine the real path of code in code blocks
during compilation, it's not intuitive to import type files via **relative paths** in code blocks.

#### Reading Path Mappings from `tsconfig.json`

The theme supports reading path mappings from `compilerOptions.paths` in `tsconfig.json` at the project root to solve this issue.

Assume your project's `tsconfig.json` is configured as follows:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can directly use paths starting with `@/` in code blocks to import type files from the `src` directory:

````md
```ts twoslash
import type { Foo } from '@/foo'

const foo: Foo = 1
```
````

#### Reading Path Mappings from `shiki.twoslash`

You can configure `compilerOptions` in `shiki.twoslash` to solve this issue:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
import path from 'node:path'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    codeHighlighter: {
      twoslash: {
        compilerOptions: { // [!code hl:8]
          paths: {
            // Relative to working directory `process.cwd()`
            '@/*': ['./src/*'],
            // Using absolute paths
            '@@/*': [path.resolve(process.cwd(), './src/*')],
          }
        }
      }
    },
  }),
})
```

You can directly use paths starting with `@/` in code blocks to import type files from the `src` directory:

````md
```ts twoslash
import type { Foo } from '@/foo'

const foo: Foo = 1
```
````

::: important
Using `plugins.shiki.twoslash.compilerOptions` allows more flexible configuration of type compilation.
You can modify `baseUrl` and other configuration options here.

[Refer to CompilerOptions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#compilerOptions)

Usually you only need to configure the `paths` option, keeping other options default unless you understand what you're configuring.
:::

## Usage

::: warning `twoslash` only supports `typescript` and `vue` code blocks.
:::

After enabling this feature, simply add the `twoslash` keyword after the code language declaration in your existing markdown code block syntax:

````md{1}
```ts twoslash
const a = 1
```
````

The theme only processes code blocks with the `twoslash` keyword.

## Syntax Reference

Complete syntax reference: [ts-twoslasher](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/tree/v2/packages/ts-twoslasher) and [shikijs-twoslash](https://twoslash.netlify.app/)

`twoslash` treats **double slashes** as preprocessor directives for code examples. Therefore, all annotations are added after `//`.

### Symbol Annotations

Common `twoslash` annotations:

#### `^?` {#extract-type}

Use `^?` to extract type information for specific identifiers on the code line above it.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
const hi = 'Hello'
const msg = `${hi}, world`
//     ^?
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
const hi = 'Hello'
const msg = `${hi}, world`
//     ^?
//
```

::: important The symbol `^` must correctly point to the variable whose type you want to highlight.
:::

#### `^|` {#completions}

Use `^|` to extract autocompletion information at a specific position.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
console.e
//       ^|
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
console.e
//       ^|
//
```

::: important The symbol `^` must correctly point to the position where you want content prediction.
:::

Twoslash requests TypeScript for autocompletion suggestions at the `^` position,
then filters possible outputs based on letters after the `.`. Up to 5 inline results are displayed,
and if a completion item is marked as deprecated, the output reflects this.

In this case, Twoslash requests completion suggestions for `console` from TypeScript,
then filters for items starting with `e`. Note the `// @noErrors` compiler flag is set because `console.e`
is a failing TypeScript code example, but we don't care about that.

#### `^^^` {#highlighting}

Use `^^^` to highlight specific ranges on the line above it.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  //     ^^^
  return a + b
}
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  //     ^^^
  return a + b
}
```

::: important Use consecutive `^` symbols to correctly point to the range you want to highlight.
:::

### `@filename` {#import-files}

`@filename: <filename>` declares which file subsequent code will come from. You can import this file via `import` in other parts of the code.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @filename: sum.ts
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}

// @filename: ok.ts
import { sum } from './sum'
sum(1, 2)

// @filename: error.ts
// @errors: 2345
import { sum } from './sum'
sum(4, 'woops')
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @filename: sum.ts
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}

// @filename: ok.ts
import { sum } from './sum'
sum(1, 2)

// @filename: error.ts
// @errors: 2345
import { sum } from './sum'
sum(4, 'woops')
```

### Code Cutting

#### `---cut-before---` {#cut-before}

After TypeScript generates the project and extracts all editor information (like identifiers,
queries, highlights, etc.), cutting operations adjust all offsets and line numbers to fit the smaller output.

Users see content below `// ---cut-before---`. The shorthand `// ---cut---` is also supported.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
const level: string = 'Danger'
// ---cut---
console.log(level)
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
const level: string = 'Danger'
// ---cut---
console.log(level)
```

Show only a single file:

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @filename: a.ts
export const helloWorld: string = 'Hi'
// ---cut---
// @filename: b.ts
import { helloWorld } from './a'

console.log(helloWorld)
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @filename: a.ts
export const helloWorld: string = 'Hi'
// ---cut---
// @filename: b.ts
import { helloWorld } from './a'

console.log(helloWorld)
```

Only the last two lines are displayed, but to TypeScript, this is a program with two files,
and all IDE information is correctly connected between files. This is why `// @filename: [file]`
is the only Twoslash command not removed, as it can be `---cut---` if irrelevant.

#### `---cut-after---` {#cut-after}

The sibling of `---cut-before---`, used to trim everything after the symbol:

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
const level: string = 'Danger'
// ---cut-before---
console.log(level)
// ---cut-after---
console.log('This is not shown')
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
const level: string = 'Danger'
// ---cut-before---
console.log(level)
// ---cut-after---
console.log('This is not shown')
```

#### `---cut-start---` and `---cut-end---` {#cut-start-end}

You can also use the `---cut-start---` and `---cut-end---` pair to cut code segments between two symbols.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
const level: string = 'Danger'
// ---cut-start---
console.log(level) // This part is cut
// ---cut-end---
console.log('This is shown')
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
const level: string = 'Danger'
// ---cut-start---
console.log(level) // This part is cut
// ---cut-end---
console.log('This is shown')
```

Multiple instances are supported to cut multiple sections, but symbols must appear in pairs.

### Custom Output Messages {id=twoslash-custom-message}

`@log`, `@error`, `@warn`, and `@annotate` output custom messages at different levels to users.

````md
```ts twoslash
// @log: Custom log message
const a = 1
// @error: Custom error message
const b = 1
// @warn: Custom warning message
const c = 1
// @annotate: Custom annotation message
```
````

```ts twoslash
// @log: Custom log message
const a = 1
// @error: Custom error message
const b = 1
// @warn: Custom warning message
const c = 1
// @annotate: Custom annotation message
```

### Output Compiled Files

Running Twoslash code examples triggers full TypeScript compilation runs that create files in a virtual
file system. You can replace code example content with results from running TypeScript on the project.

#### `@showEmit`

`// @showEmit` is the primary command to tell Twoslash you want to replace the code example output with the equivalent `.js` file.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @showEmit
const level: string = 'Danger'
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @showEmit
const level: string = 'Danger'
```

The result shows the `.js` file corresponding to this `.ts` file. You can see TypeScript output removes `: string` and adds `export {}`.

#### `@showEmittedFile: [file]`

While `.js` files may be the most useful out of the box, TypeScript does emit other files (`.d.ts` and `.map`)
when proper flags are enabled, and with multi-file code examples, you may need to tell Twoslash which file to
display. For all these cases, you can also add `@showEmittedFile: [file]` to tell Twoslash which file you want to display.

**Display `.d.ts` file for TypeScript code example:**

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @declaration
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: index.d.ts
export const hello = 'world'
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @declaration
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: index.d.ts
export const hello = 'world'
```

**Display `.map` file from JavaScript to TypeScript:**

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @sourceMap
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: index.js.map
export const hello = 'world'
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @sourceMap
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: index.js.map
export const hello = 'world'
```

**Display `.map` for `.d.ts` files (mainly for project references):**

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @declaration
// @declarationMap
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: index.d.ts.map
export const hello: string = 'world'
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @declaration
// @declarationMap
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: index.d.ts.map
export const hello: string = 'world'
```

**Generate `.js` file for `b.ts`:**

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: b.js
// @filename: a.ts
export const helloWorld: string = 'Hi'

// @filename: b.ts
import { helloWorld } from './a'
console.log(helloWorld)
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @showEmit
// @showEmittedFile: b.js
// @filename: a.ts
export const helloWorld: string = 'Hi'

// @filename: b.ts
import { helloWorld } from './a'
console.log(helloWorld)
```

### `@errors`

`@errors: <error code>` shows how code produces errors:

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322 2588
const str: string = 1
str = 'Hello'
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322 2588
const str: string = 1
str = 'Hello'
```

You need to declare corresponding TypeScript error codes after `@errors`. Separate multiple error codes with spaces.

::: note
If you don't know which error code to add, try writing the code first and wait for compilation to fail.
You should see relevant error information in the console, then find the corresponding error code in the
error message's `description`. Then add the error code to `@errors`.

Don't worry about compilation failures terminating the process - the theme displays error information
when compilation fails while outputting uncompiled code in the code block.
:::

### `@noErrors`

Suppresses all errors in code. You can also provide error codes to suppress specific errors.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const str: string = 1
str = 'Hello'
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const str: string = 1
str = 'Hello'
```

### `@noErrorsCutted`

Ignores errors occurring in cut code.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @noErrorsCutted
const hello = 'world'
// ---cut-after---
hello = 'hi' // Should be an error but ignored because it's cut.
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @noErrorsCutted
const hello = 'world'
// ---cut-after---
hello = 'hi' // Should be an error but ignored because it's cut.
```

### `@noErrorValidation`

Disables error validation. Error messages will still render, but Twoslash won't throw errors from compile-time code.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @noErrorValidation
const str: string = 1
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @noErrorValidation
const str: string = 1
```

### `@keepNotations`

Tells Twoslash not to remove any comments and keep original code unchanged. Nodes will contain position information of original code.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @keepNotations
// @module: esnext
// @errors: 2322
const str: string = 1
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @keepNotations
// @module: esnext
// @errors: 2322
const str: string = 1
```

### Overriding Compiler Options

Use `// @name` and `// @name: value` comments to override TypeScript's
[compiler options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#compilerOptions). These comments will be removed from output.

**Input:**

````md
```ts twoslash
// @noImplicitAny: false
// @target: esnext
// @lib: esnext
// This should throw an error,
// but since we disabled noImplicitAny, it won't.
const fn = a => a + 1
```
````

**Output:**

```ts twoslash
// @noImplicitAny: false
// @target: esnext
// @lib: esnext
// This should throw an error,
// but since we disabled noImplicitAny, it won't.
const fn = a => a + 1
```

# Demo Container
## Overview

Sometimes you may need to supplement your content with examples but want them to be presented
separately from other content. The theme supports adding demo containers in Markdown files.

## Syntax

```md
::: window
Add your demo here
:::
```

## Options

* `title="xxx"`: Title
* `no-padding`: Remove padding
* `img`: Use when containing only images
* `height="xxx"`: Height

## Examples

Containing only images:

```md
::: window
![hero](/images/custom-hero.jpg)
:::
```

**Output:**
::: window
![hero](/images/custom-hero.jpg)
:::

Containing markdown syntax:

```md
::: window title="Title"
### Level 3 Heading

This is content inside the demo container.
:::
```

**Output:**
::: window title="Title"

### Level 3 Heading

This is content inside the demo container.
:::

Containing HTML/Vue code:

```md
::: window
<h1 class="your-demo-title">This is a heading</h1>
<p class="your-demo-paragraph">This is a paragraph</p>

<style>
  .your-demo-title {
    color: red;
  }
  .your-demo-paragraph {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
:::
```

**Output:**
::: window

# Build Optimization
## Image Dimension Optimization&#x20;

When embedding images in Markdown documents via `![alt](url)` or `<img src="url">`,
the content displays correctly, but potential layout stability issues are often overlooked.

### Layout Shift Analysis

Layout shifts are not obvious when images are small or network conditions are good.
However, with large images or poor network conditions, layout reflow during image loading becomes prominent:

1. **Before Loading**: Image placeholder space is not reserved, subsequent content is pushed up
2. **After Loading**: Image suddenly occupies space, forcing subsequent content to reflow
3. **User Experience**: Frequent layout changes cause visual jumps and operation lag

### Solution: Pre-calculate Image Dimensions

According to [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#height),
specifying both `height` and `width` attributes allows browsers to calculate the image aspect
ratio in advance and reserve display space, eliminating layout shifts at the source.

Automated solution provided by the theme:

```ts
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: {
      markdownPower: {
        imageSize: true, // Optional 'local' | 'all'
      },
    }
  })
})
```

**Configuration Options**:

* `'local'` or `true`: Only add dimension attributes for local images
* `'all'`: Process both local and remote image resources

**Implementation Mechanism**:

* Automatically analyze original image dimensions during build
* Inject precise `width` and `height` attributes into `<img>` tags
* Reserve display space based on image aspect ratio

::: important Performance Considerations

* This feature only takes effect in **production builds** to avoid performance overhead during development
* Using the `'all'` option requests all remote image resources, which may significantly increase build time
* Optimization strategy: Concurrent requests + header information analysis, terminating connections immediately after obtaining dimension data
  :::

## Icon Loading Optimization

### Iconify Integration Benefits

The theme deeply integrates with the [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) project,
providing access to over 200,000 icons with flexible selection. Although locally installing the
`@iconify/json` package requires approximately 70MB of storage,
only the actually used icon resources are included in the build, achieving on-demand loading.

### Performance Bottlenecks and Solutions

**Root Cause**:
Icons are organized by collections, with each collection containing JSON files of 100-1000+ icons.
When using icons from multiple different collections, frequent I/O reads and JSON parsing create significant performance overhead.

**Real-world Case**:

* Using 160+ icons from 54 icon collections
* Initial build: ~500ms icon parsing time
* User experience: Slow development server startup

**Cache Optimization Mechanism**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[First Build] --> B[Parse Used Icons]
    B --> C[Generate Cache File]
    C --> D[Subsequent Builds]
    D --> E[Read Cache]
    E --> F[20ms Loading Time]
```

**Optimization Results**:

* Build time reduced from 500ms to 20ms
* Development server startup speed significantly improved
* Maximum resource utilization

### Best Practice Recommendations

1. **Icon Usage Planning**:
   * Prioritize icons from the same collection
   * Avoid overly dispersed usage across different collections

2. **Development Experience Optimization**:
   * Cache automatically takes effect after first startup
   * Intelligent cache updates when adding new icons
   * No manual cache management required

3. **Production Build Assurance**:
   * Cache mechanism doesn't affect final output
   * Maintains on-demand loading characteristics of icon resources
   * Ensures optimal build artifact size

Through these two optimization measures, the theme maintains rich functionality while ensuring excellent build performance and runtime experience.

This guide provides a detailed explanation of the file structure for projects
created using VuePress and the Plume theme, helping you better organize and manage project files.

For projects created via the [command-line tool](./usage.md#command-line-installation), the typical file structure is as follows:

::: file-tree

* .git/
* **docs** # Documentation source directory
  * .vuepress  # VuePress configuration directory
    * public/ # Static assets
    * client.ts # Client configuration (optional)
    * collections.ts # Collections configuration (optional)
    * config.ts # VuePress main configuration
    * navbar.ts # Navbar configuration (optional)
    * plume.config.ts # Theme configuration file (optional)
  * demo # `doc` type collection
    * foo.md
    * bar.md
  * blog # `post` type collection
    * preview # Blog category
      * markdown.md # Category article
    * article.md # Blog article
  * README.md # Site homepage
  * …
* package.json
* pnpm-lock.yaml
* .gitignore
* README.md
  :::

::: tip Manually created projects can also be organized using this structure as a reference
:::

## Documentation Source Directory

The **Documentation Source Directory** contains all the Markdown source files for your site.
This directory must be specified when starting VuePress via the command line:

```sh
# [!code word:docs]
vuepress dev docs
#            ↑ Documentation source directory
```

Corresponding package.json script configuration:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:dev": "vuepress dev docs",
    "docs:build": "vuepress build docs"
  }
}
```

VuePress only processes files within the documentation source directory; other directories are ignored.

## `.vuepress` Configuration Directory

`.vuepress/` is the core configuration directory for VuePress, where you can configure your project, create custom components, and styles.

### `client.ts` - Client Configuration

Used to extend VuePress client functionality, such as registering global components:

```ts title=".vuepress/client.ts"
import { defineClientConfig } from 'vuepress/client'

export default defineClientConfig({
  enhance({ app, router, siteData }) {
    // app: Vue application instance
    // router: Vue Router instance
    // siteData: Site metadata

    // Register global components
    app.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)
  },
  setup() {
    // setup method of the Vue root component
  }
})
```

### `config.ts` - Main Configuration File

The core configuration file for VuePress, used to set up the theme, plugins, and build tool:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { viteBundler } from '@vuepress/bundler-vite'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  lang: 'zh-CN',
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Theme configuration...
  }),
  bundler: viteBundler(),
})
```

### `plume.config.ts` - Theme Configuration

A dedicated configuration file for the theme that supports hot-reload; service restart is not required after modifications:

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ./navbar.ts
export default []

// @filename: ./collections.ts
export default []
// ---cut---
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import collections from './collections'
import navbar from './navbar'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  logo: '/logo.svg',
  profile: {
    name: 'Theme Plume',
  },
  navbar,
  collections,
  // More configuration...
})
```

@tab .vuepress/navbar.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineNavbarConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineNavbarConfig([
  // Navbar item configuration...
])
```

@tab .vuepress/collections.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineCollections } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineCollections([
  {
    type: 'post',
    dir: 'blog',
    title: 'Blog',
    link: '/blog/'
  },
  {
    type: 'doc',
    dir: 'demo',
    linkPrefix: '/demo/',
    title: 'Documentation Examples',
    sidebar: 'auto'
  },
])
```

::: important Legacy Frontend Code Demo Deprecated - Please Migrate to New Solution

The legacy solution was provided by [vuepress-plugin-md-enhance](https://plugin-md-enhance.vuejs.press/zh/).
We appreciate its support for code demos in the past. The code demo functionality in
`vuepress-plugin-md-enhance` will be migrated to [vuepress/ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem). For details, please refer to [vuepress/ecosystem#293](https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem/pull/293).

:::

::: details Why Redesign?

Frontend code demos are a highly useful feature, but the legacy implementation did not align with actual usage scenario expectations.

In the legacy solution, for example, `vue-demo` only supported simple Vue component demonstrations
and could not directly import dependencies from the project. It relied on loading external scripts for
additional functionality and did not provide full support for Vue SFC, being limited to simple code demonstrations.

Furthermore, script code compilation occurred in the browser runtime. It required loading `babel` from a
CDN first, then performing the transformation via `babel`, which introduced additional waiting time.
Additionally, for internal enterprise projects within an intranet environment that cannot access external
resources, the demos failed to display properly.

In the new solution, all demo code is compiled and transformed during the Node.js runtime.
Therefore, demo code can be displayed directly in the browser runtime without extra waiting time.
Leveraging Node.js's powerful capabilities, it fully supports all features of Vue SFC and allows direct
import of project dependencies, enabling richer demonstrations that better match real-world usage scenarios.
:::

## Overview

This feature supports embedding code demonstration functionality within pages. A frontend code demo consists of two main areas:
\==Render Area== and ==Code Area==.

The **Render Area** displays the execution results of the code, including UI rendering and interactions.
The **Code Area** displays the source code and is collapsed by default.

The theme provides support for three different types of frontend code demos:

* \==Vue Component Demo==: Supports demonstrations of `Vue` components.
  Write your demo code as you would a `Vue` component.
  It can be used to demonstrate external dependencies like component libraries or `Composables API`.
* \==Markdown Demo==: Supports demonstrations of `Markdown`.
* \==Normal Code Demo==: Supports native `HTML` + `JS/TS` + `CSS/Less/Sass/Stylus` code demos. Write your demo code as you would a web page.

The theme also provides two different methods for writing demo code:

* Embed Demo Code Files:

  ```md
  @[demo type](url)
  ```

  Use simple embedding syntax to import demo code from files.

* Inline Demo Code within Demo Container:

  ````md
  ::: demo type
  ``` [lang]
  code
  ```
  :::
  ````

  Write demo code directly within the markdown file, wrapped in a `demo` container.

## Configuration

Frontend code demos are powered by [vuepress-plugin-md-power](../../config/plugins/markdown-power.md).

Frontend code demos are disabled by default. You can enable them via configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      demo: true, // [!code ++]
    },
  })
})
```

## Language Support

Code demos support the following languages:

* javascript
* typescript
* html
* css
* less
* sass
* stylus

For CSS preprocessor languages, you need to install the corresponding preprocessor in your project, such as `less`, `sass`, or `stylus`.

## Embed Syntax

Different code demos use the same embed syntax, allowing you to quickly grasp their usage.

```md
<!-- Syntax -->
@[demo](url)
@[demo [type]](url)
@[demo [type] title="" desc="" expanded code-setting=""](url)
```

`@[demo](url)` is a fixed syntax format.

`[type]` indicates the type and supports three different values:

* `normal`: Normal code demo type. This is the default type when the `[type]` parameter is omitted.
* `vue`: Vue component demo type.
* `markdown`: Markdown demo type.

`url` indicates the path to the demo code file, which can be relative or absolute.

* Relative paths start with `./` or `../` and are relative to the current markdown file's path.
* Absolute paths start with `/` and are resolved from the [VuePress source directory path](../quick-start/project-structure.md#document-source-directory).

```md
<!-- Normal Code Demo -->
@[demo](./demo/normal.html)
@[demo normal](./demo/normal.html)
@[demo](/.vuepress/demo/normal.html)

<!-- Vue Component Demo -->
@[demo vue](./demo/Counter.vue)
@[demo vue](./demo/Counter.ts)
@[demo](/.vuepress/demo/Counter.vue)

<!-- Markdown Demo -->
@[demo markdown](./demo/example.md)
@[demo markdown](/.vuepress/demo/example.md)
```

Additional parameters:

* `title="xxx"`: Demo title.
* `desc="xxx"`: Demo description.
* `expanded`: Expand the code area.
* `code-setting="xxx"`: Code settings. The value will be appended after \`\`\` \[lang]\` and is used to add configurations to the code block.

  `code-setting=":lines-number"` will add `:lines-number` after the code block, enabling line numbers.

  `code-setting=":collapsed-lines=10"` will add `:collapsed-lines=10` after the code block,
  causing the code block to be collapsed starting from line 10.

```md
@[demo vue expanded title="Title" desc="Description" code-setting=":collapsed-lines=10"](./demo/Counter.vue)
```

## Demo Container Inline Demo

Demo container inline demos use the `demo` container to wrap the demo code, allowing quick writing of demo code within the markdown file:

```md
::: demo [type] title="" desc="" expanded
<!-- Code Block -->
:::
```

All parameters are the same as the `@[demo](url)` syntax.

````md
<!-- Normal Code Demo -->
::: demo
```html
<!-- html code -->
```
``` js
// js code
```
``` css
/* css code */
```
:::

<!-- Vue Component Demo -->
::: demo vue
``` vue
<!-- vue code -->
```
:::

<!-- Markdown Demo -->
::: demo markdown
``` md
<!-- markdown code -->
```
:::
````

You can also wrap code blocks with the `::: code-tabs` container within the `::: demo` container for better interactive presentation.

````md
:::: demo
::: code-tabs
@tab HTML
```html
<!-- html code -->
```
@tab javascript
``` js
// js code
```
@tab css
``` css
/* css code */
```
:::
:::::
````

When using TypeScript or `Less/Sass/Stylus`, simply modify the value of ` ``` [lang]`:

````md
:::: demo
::: code-tabs
@tab HTML
```html
<!-- html code -->
```
@tab Typescript
``` ts
// ts code
```
@tab Scss
``` scss
/* scss code */
```
:::
:::::
````

## Vue Component Demo

Vue component demo is a powerful feature with no restrictions on the demo code—it ultimately depends on the `bundler`'s support for Vue.
You can directly import dependencies installed in your project within the demo code, just as you would when writing a component in a Vue project.

Therefore, you can use it directly to provide demonstration examples for your component library or for your `Composables API`.

### Embed Syntax

You can directly embed a Vue component demo in a page using the following method:

**Input:**

```md
@[demo vue title="Counter" desc="Click the +1 button to increment the counter by 1"](./demo/Counter.vue)
```

::: details View `./demo/Counter.vue` Code

@[code](./demo/Counter.vue)

:::

**Output:**

@[demo vue title="Counter" desc="Click the +1 button to increment the counter by 1"](./demo/Counter.vue)

***

You can also embed a Vue component written in `.ts`:

**Input:**

```md
@[demo vue title="Counter" desc="Click the +1 button to increment the counter by 1"](./demo/Counter.ts)
```

::: details View `./demo/Counter.ts` Code

::: code-tabs
@tab Counter.ts
@[code](./demo/Counter.ts)
@tab Counter.module.css
@[code](./demo/Counter.module.css)
:::

**Output:**

@[demo vue title="Counter" desc="Click the +1 button to increment the counter by 1"](./demo/Counter.ts)

:::info For components written in `.js/.ts`, use `CSS Module` to write styles for style isolation.
:::

***

You can import external dependencies in the demo code.
Example using `useToggle()` from `@vueuse/core`:

**Input:**

```md
@[demo vue title="useToggle" desc="useToggle() Demo"](./demo/Toggle.vue)
```

::: details ./demo/Toggle.vue
@[code](./demo/Toggle.vue)
:::

**Output:**

@[demo vue title="useToggle" desc="useToggle() Demo"](./demo/Toggle.vue)

### Container Syntax

Using the `demo` container to wrap demo code in a markdown file allows for quick demo code writing:

**Input:**

:::: details Expand to view full code

````md
::: demo vue title="Counter" desc="Click the +1 button to increment the counter by 1"
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="counter">
    <p>Counter: {{ count }}</p>
    <button type="button" class="btn" @click="count += 1">
      + 1
    </button>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.btn {
  border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider);
  border-radius: 4px;
}
</style>
```
:::
````

::::

**Output:**

::: demo vue title="Counter" desc="Click the +1 button to increment the counter by 1"

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <div class="counter">
    <p>Counter: {{ count }}</p>
    <button type="button" class="btn" @click="count += 1">
      + 1
    </button>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.btn {
  border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider);
  border-radius: 4px;
}
</style>
```

:::

:::::: warning
The Vue demo container syntax also supports embedding demo code using the `.js/ts + css` approach,
but this is not recommended by the theme. Styles cannot be isolated, which may lead to style pollution.

::::: details Reference Example

````md
:::: demo vue title="Title" desc="Description"
::: code-tabs
@tab Counter.ts
```ts
import { defineComponent, ref } from 'vue'

export default defineComponent({
  // code
})
```
@tab Counter.css
```css
/* css code */
```
:::
::::
````

:::::
::::::

## Normal Code Demo

Normal code demos support `html`, `css/less/sass/stylus`, and `js/ts` languages.

They are suitable for relatively simple code demonstrations, such as a style rendering effect, an interaction effect, or a functionality.

Normal code demos also support jumping to `CodePen` and `jsFiddle` for viewing.

Additionally, they support importing third-party libraries via external links, such as `jQuery` or `dayjs`.

::: warning Overly complex demonstrations are not recommended.
:::

### Embed Syntax

When using the embed syntax, use `.html` as the file suffix for the imported demo code file.
In the `.html` file, you can write the demo code as you would an HTML page:

```html
<!-- html code -->
<div id="app">
  Demo Content
<div>

<!-- Script content, use lang attribute to set language, defaults to js -->
<script lang="ts">
</script>

<!-- Style content, use lang attribute to set language, defaults to css -->
<style lang="css">
</style>

<!-- Optional configuration file in json format -->
<script type="config">
{
  "jsLib": [],
  "cssLib": []
}
</script>
```

Each section is optional. However, note that multiple identical sections are not supported. The order of sections does not matter.
Content outside of `<script>` and `<style>` is considered HTML code.

You can declare additional dependency resources to load using JSON format within `<script type="config"></script>`.

For example, loading `jQuery` and `normalize.css`:

```html
<div>xxxx</div>

<script type="config">
{
  "jsLib": [
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.7.1/dist/jquery.min.js"
  ],
  "cssLib": [
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/normalize.css@8.0.1/normalize.min.css"
  ]
}
</script>
```

# Rust
## Overview

The theme provides Rust code demonstration functionality, supporting online execution of Rust code.

::: important
This functionality works by submitting code to a server for compilation and execution, and only a single code file can be submitted at a time.

Therefore, please do not use this feature to execute overly complex code, and avoid making execution requests too frequently.
:::

## Configuration

This feature is disabled by default. You can enable it through configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    markdown: {
      repl: {
        rust: true,
      },
    },
  })
})
```

## Usage

Use the `::: rust-repl` container syntax to wrap Rust code blocks. The theme will detect the code blocks and add execution buttons.

### Read-only Code Demo

Rust code demos are read-only by default and cannot be edited.

````md
::: rust-repl title="Custom Title"
```rust
// your rust code
```
:::
````

### Editable Code Demo

For online editing and execution, wrap the code block in the `::: rust-repl editable` container syntax.

````md
::: rust-repl editable title="Custom Title"
```rust
// your rust code
```
:::
````

## Examples

### Print Content

**Input:**

````md
::: rust-repl title="Print Content"
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: rust-repl title="Print Content"

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

:::

Click the Execute button to run the code.

### Print Error Information

**Input:**

````md
::: rust-repl
```rust
fn main() {
    printlnl!("Hello, world!");
}
```
:::
````

**Output:**

::: rust-repl

```rust
fn main() {
    printlnl!("Hello, world!");
}
```

:::

### Wait for Child Process Execution

**Input:**

````md
::: rust-repl
```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    let mut child = Command::new("sleep").arg("5").spawn().unwrap();
    let _result = child.wait().unwrap();

    println!("reached end of main");
}
```
:::
````

**Output:**

# SEO
## Usage

The theme provides out-of-the-box configuration to enable SEO optimization features for your site.
To enable it, configure the following:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    hostname: 'http://your_site_url',
  })
})
```

For custom SEO optimization, you can configure it through `plugins.seo`:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: {
      seo: {
        // ... SEO configuration
      }
    }
  })
})
```

For complete configuration options, please refer to the [documentation](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/en/plugins/seo/seo/config.html).

::: note
This example is forked from [@vuepress/plugin-seo](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/en/plugins/seo/seo/),
licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/vuepress/ecosystem/blob/main/LICENSE).
:::

## Guide

The theme enhances your site's search engine optimization by injecting tags into the website's `<head>` section,
making it fully compliant with the [Open Graph Protocol (OGP)](https://ogp.me/)
and [JSON-LD 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-api/).

By default, the plugin reads site configuration, theme configuration, and page frontmatter to automatically generate
metadata. Elements such as site name, page title, page type, writing date, last update date, and article tags are automatically generated.

## Default OGP Generation Logic

| Property Name | Value |
| :------------ | :---- |
| `og:url` | `options.hostname` + `path` |
| `og:site_name` | `siteConfig.title` |
| `og:title` | `page.title` |
| `og:description` | `page.frontmatter.description` || auto-generated (when `autoDescription` is `true` in plugin options) |
| `og:type` | `"article"` |
| `og:image` | `options.hostname` + `page.frontmatter.image` || first image in page || `fallbackImage` from plugin options |
| `og:updated_time` | `page.git.updatedTime` |
| `og:locale` | `page.lang` |
| `og:locale:alternate` | Other languages included in `siteData.locales` |
| `twitter:card` | `"summary_large_image"` (only when image is found) |
| `twitter:image:alt` | `page.title` (only when image is found) |
| `article:author` | `page.frontmatter.author` || `options.author` |
| `article:tag` | `page.frontmatter.tags` || `page.frontmatter.tag` |
| `article:published_time` | `page.frontmatter.date` || `page.git.createdTime` |
| `article:modified_time` | `page.git.updatedTime` |

## Default JSON-LD Generation Logic

| Property Name | Value |
| :------------ | :---- |
| `@context` | `"https://schema.org"` |
| `@type` | `"NewsArticle"` |
| `headline` | `page.title` |
| `image` | Images in page || `options.hostname` + `page.frontmatter.image` |
| `datePublished` | `page.frontmatter.date` || `page.git.createdTime` |
| `dateModified` | `page.git.updatedTime` |
| `author` | `page.frontmatter.author` || `options.author` |

## SEO Introduction

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a method of adjusting websites by understanding search engine operation rules
to improve a target website's ranking in search engines. Since many studies have found that search engine users
often only pay attention to the top few entries in search results, many websites hope to influence search engine
rankings through various methods to achieve excellent search rankings for their sites.

The so-called "optimization for search engines" refers to making websites more easily accepted by search engines.
Search engines compare the content between websites for relevance, and then browsers present this content to searchers
in the fastest and most complete way possible. Search engine optimization follows search engine rules to create better
user experiences, with the ultimate goal of providing excellent user experience.

# Sidebar
## Overview

Sidebar is a common page navigation method in documentation, enabling quick positioning to document content.

The theme provides two ways to configure the sidebar:

* Configure sidebar through the `sidebar` option in theme configuration
* Configure sidebar in [collections of type `doc`](./collection-doc.md)

## File Structure and Basic Configuration

### Directory Structure Design

A typical project structure might look like:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * typescript     # TypeScript Study Notes
    * basic.md
    * types.md
  * rust           # Rust Programming Notes
    * tuple.md
    * struct.md
  * README.md        # Site Homepage
    :::

### Configuration via `sidebar`

This approach is suitable for simple and compact documentation sites.

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    sidebar: {
      '/typescript/': [
        'basic',
        'types'
      ],
      '/rust/': [
        'tuple',
        'struct'
      ]
    }
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  sidebar: {
    '/typescript/': [
      'basic',
      'types'
    ],
    '/rust/': [
      'tuple',
      'struct'
    ]
  }
})
```

:::

### Configuration via `collection`&#x20;

`collections` can flexibly organize and manage different categories of documents within a site. This approach is suitable for complex sites.

::: code-tabs#config

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```js twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections: [
      {
        type: 'doc',
        dir: 'typescript',
        linkPrefix: '/typescript/',
        title: 'TypeScript Notes',
        sidebar: ['basic', 'types'],
      },
      {
        type: 'doc',
        dir: 'rust',
        linkPrefix: '/rust/',
        title: 'Rust Notes',
        sidebar: ['tuple', 'struct'],
      }
    ],
  })
})
```

@tab .vuepress/plume.config.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineThemeConfig } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineThemeConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      type: 'doc',
      dir: 'typescript',
      linkPrefix: '/typescript/',
      title: 'TypeScript Notes',
      sidebar: ['basic', 'types'],
    },
    {
      type: 'doc',
      dir: 'rust',
      linkPrefix: '/rust/',
      title: 'Rust Notes',
      sidebar: ['tuple', 'struct'],
    }
  ],
})
```

:::

::: tip Configuration Timing Recommendation
Complete the collection configuration before creating document files.
The theme's [auto-frontmatter](../../config/theme.md#autofrontmatter) feature will automatically
generate permanent links and sidebar structures based on the configuration.
:::

## Advanced Configuration Management

### Modular Configuration Solution

For complex projects, it's recommended to use the type-safe configuration tools provided by the theme:

::: code-tabs

@tab .vuepress/collections.ts

```ts twoslash
import { defineCollection, defineCollections } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

// Single collection configuration
const typescript = defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'typescript',
  title: 'TypeScript Notes',
  linkPrefix: '/typescript/',
  sidebar: [
    'guide/intro.md',
    'guide/getting-start.md',
    'config/config-file.md',
  ]
})

// Export all collection configurations
export default defineCollections([
  typescript
])
```

@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ./collections.ts
export default []

// ---cut---
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import collections from './collections' // [!code ++]

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections // [!code ++]
  }),
})
```

:::

### Large Project Configuration Splitting

When dealing with numerous collections, a modular configuration structure can be adopted:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * .vuepress
    * collections
      * typescript.ts
      * rust.ts
      * index.ts
      * …
  * typescript/
  * rust/
    :::

Configuration code organization example:

::: code-tabs
@tab .vuepress/config.ts

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ./collections/index.ts
export default []

// ---cut---
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import collections from './collections/index.ts' // [!code ++]

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    collections // [!code ++]
  }),
})
```

@tab .vuepress/collections/index.ts

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ./rust.ts
export default {}
// @filename: ./typescript.ts
export default {}

// ---cut---
import { defineCollections } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'
import rust from './rust' // [!code ++]
import typescript from './typescript' // [!code ++]

export default defineCollections([
  rust,
  typescript,
])
```

@tab .vuepress/collections/typescript.ts

```ts
import { defineCollection } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'typescript',
  link: '/typescript/',
  title: 'TypeScript Notes',
  sidebar: [
    'guide/intro.md',
    'guide/getting-start.md',
    'config/config-file.md',
  ]
})
```

:::

## Sidebar Configuration Details

### File Structure Example

Assume the TypeScript Notes contain the following structure:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * typescript
    * guide
      * intro.md
      * getting-start.md
    * config
      * config-file.md
      * configuration.md
    * reference
      * basic.md
      * syntax.md
      * modules.md
    * built-in
      * types
        * Required.md
        * Omit.md
    * README.md
      :::

### Auto-generated Sidebar

The simplest configuration uses auto-generation:

```ts
import { defineCollection } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'typescript',
  sidebar: 'auto' // Auto-generate sidebar // [!code ++]
})
```

The theme automatically configures the sidebar based on the directory structure.

**Sorting Control**: Manage display order through numeric prefixes

::: file-tree

* typescript
  * 1.guide
    * 1.intro.md
    * 2.getting-start.md
  * 2.config
    * 1.config-file.md
    * 2.configuration.md
  * …
    :::

Numeric prefixes are used only for sorting and are not displayed in the sidebar.

**Auto-collapse**: By default, the sidebar does not auto-collapse. You can enable auto-collapse by configuring `sidebarCollapsed`:

```ts
import { defineCollection } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'typescript',
  sidebar: 'auto',
  sidebarCollapsed: true, // [!code ++]
})
```

`sidebarCollapsed` has the following optional values:

* `undefined`: Default, no auto-collapse
* `true`: Default all collapsed
* `false`: Default all expanded

### Auto-generated Sub-sidebar

For more flexible sidebar control and reduced configuration complexity, the theme allows configuring only auto-generated sub-sidebars:

```ts
import { defineCollection } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineCollection({
  type: 'doc',
  dir: 'typescript',
  sidebar: [
    // Sub-items automatically read the typescript/guide directory
    { text: 'Guide', prefix: 'guide', items: 'auto' },
    // Sub-items automatically read the typescript/config directory
    { text: 'Configuration', prefix: 'config', items: 'auto' },
  ],
})
```

### Custom Sidebar Configuration

#### Basic Configuration Types

```ts
interface SidebarItem {
  text?: string // Display text
  link?: string // Link address
  icon?: ThemeIcon // Icon configuration
  badge?: string | ThemeBadge // Badge
  prefix?: string // Link prefix
  items?: 'auto' | (string | SidebarItem)[] // Next level sidebar
  collapsed?: boolean // Collapse state
}
```

#### Configuration Examples

**Basic Link Configuration**:

Using shorthand form, you can pass markdown file paths or page link addresses.
The theme automatically reads the file's `frontmatter` configuration for sidebar settings.

```ts
sidebar: [
  // For absolute paths:
  // In themeConfig.sidebar, paths are relative to the `key` prefix
  // In collections, paths are relative to `dir`
  '/guide/intro.md', // Markdown file path
  '/guide/getting-start/', // Page link address
  '/config/config-file', // Can omit `.md` extension
]
```

**Complete Object Configuration**:

```ts
sidebar: [
  { text: 'Introduction', link: '/guide/intro' },
  { text: 'Quick Start', link: '/guide/getting-start' },
]
```

**Nested Group Configuration**:

```ts
sidebar: [
  {
    text: 'Guide',
    prefix: '/guide',
    items: [
      { text: 'Introduction', link: 'intro' },
      'getting-start', // Shorthand form
    ],
  },
  {
    text: 'Configuration',
    prefix: '/config',
    items: 'auto', // Auto-generate sidebar for this group
  },
]
```

### Prefix Path Processing Rules

`prefix` is used to simplify link configurations with the same prefix:

```ts
const sidebarItem: SidebarItem = {
  prefix: '/guide',
  items: [
    'intro', // → /guide/intro.md
    '/config/config-file', // → /config/config-file.md (absolute path)
    { link: '/blog/' }, // → /guide/blog/
    { link: '/config/' } // → /config.md (absolute path)
  ]
}
```

**Path Judgment Rules**:

* Starts with `/`: Absolute path, does not concatenate prefix
* Other cases: Relative path, concatenated with prefix

**Multi-level Nesting Example**:

```ts
const sidebarItem: SidebarItem = {
  prefix: '/guide',
  items: [
    'intro', // → /guide/intro.md
    {
      prefix: '/config', // Absolute path, discards parent prefix
      items: ['config-file'] // → /config/config-file.md
    },
    {
      prefix: 'blog', // Relative path, concatenates with parent prefix
      items: ['intro'] // → /guide/blog/intro.md
    }
  ]
}
```

::: warning Depth Limitation
Avoid sidebar configurations with more than 3 levels of nesting, as excessive depth affects user experience and interface aesthetics.
:::

## Visual Enhancement Features

### Icon Configuration

Supports multiple icon sources, configured via `markdown.icon.provide`:

```ts
sidebar: [
  {
    text: 'Guide',
    prefix: '/guide',
    icon: 'ep:guide', // Iconify icon
    items: [
      { text: 'Introduction', link: 'intro', icon: 'ph:info-light' },
    ],
  },
]
```

**Local Icon Configuration**:

```ts
const sidebarItem: SidebarItem = {
  text: 'Guide',
  icon: '/images/guide.png', // Local image
  items: [
    {
      text: 'Introduction',
      icon: 'https://example.com/icon.png' // Remote image
    },
  ]
}
```

::: important Local Resource Paths
Local image paths should start with `/` and correspond to the `.vuepress/public/` directory:

::: file-tree

* docs
  * .vuepress
    * public
      * images
        * guide.png
        * info.png
          :::

### Badge Feature&#x20;

Provide additional information hints through badges:

```ts
sidebar: [
  {
    text: 'Guide',
    badge: { text: 'New', type: 'danger' }, // Object form
    items: [
      { text: 'Introduction', badge: 'Recommended' }, // String shorthand
    ],
  },
]
```

**Frontmatter Configuration**:

```md
---
title: Introduction
badge:
  text: New Feature
  type: danger
---
```

### Group Separators

Add visual separation in complex sidebars:

```ts
sidebar: [
  {
    text: 'Guide',
    items: [
      'Item 1',
      'Item 2',
      { text: 'Advanced Features', link: '---' }, // Separator
      'Item 3',
      'Item 4',
    ],
  },
]
```

**Separator Characteristic**: The `link` field contains at least three consecutive `-` characters

# sitemap
## Usage

The theme provides out-of-the-box configuration to generate a `sitemap.xml` file for the site.
To enable it, the following configuration is required:

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    hostname: 'http://your_site_url',
  })
})
```

If customization of the sitemap is needed, it can be achieved through the `plugins.sitemap` configuration.

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts"
export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    plugins: {
      sitemap: {
        // ... sitemap configurations
      }
    }
  })
})
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/zh/plugins/seo/sitemap/config.html) for the complete configuration.

::: details Command Line Tool Usage Guide

Using Windows as an example:

1. Press `Win + R` to open the "Run" dialog
2. Enter `cmd` or `powershell` and press Enter

If the current directory is incorrect, use the following commands to switch:

```sh
D:                    # Switch to D drive (adjust according to your situation)
cd open-source        # Enter the target directory
```

You can then execute `pnpm create vuepress-theme-plume@latest` to create the project.
The project will be located in the `D:\open-source\my-project` directory.
:::

## Manual Installation

::: info Important Notes

* When using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), `vue` must be additionally installed as peer-dependencies
* When using [Yarn 2+](https://yarnpkg.com/), set `nodeLinker: 'node-modules'` in `.yarnrc.yml`
  :::

If manual installation is required, follow these steps:

:::: steps

* ### Create Project Directory

  ```sh
  mkdir my-blog
  cd my-blog
  ```

* ### Initialize Project

  ::: npm-to

  ```sh
  git init
  npm init
  ```

  :::

* ### Install Core Dependencies

  Install `vuepress@next` and the theme package:

  ::: npm-to

  ```sh
  # Install VuePress
  npm i -D vuepress@next vue
  # Install theme and build tool
  npm i -D vuepress-theme-plume @vuepress/bundler-vite@next
  ```

  :::

  ::: warning Version Compatibility
  The current theme is adapted to vuepress@{{ vuepressVersion }}. Using other versions may cause compatibility issues.
  :::

* ### Configure Build Scripts

  Add the following to `package.json`:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "docs:dev": "vuepress dev docs",
      "docs:build": "vuepress build docs"
    }
  }
  ```

  VuePress uses the `docs` directory as the documentation root by default.

* ### Configure Git Ignore Rules

  ::: code-tabs
  @tab .gitignore

  ```txt
  node_modules
  .temp
  .cache
  ```

  @tab sh

  ```sh
  echo 'node_modules' >> .gitignore
  echo '.temp' >> .gitignore
  echo '.cache' >> .gitignore
  ```

  :::

* ### Configure Theme

  ```ts title="docs/.vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
  import { viteBundler } from '@vuepress/bundler-vite'
  import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
  import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

  export default defineUserConfig({
    // Default language must be set
    lang: 'zh-CN',
    theme: plumeTheme({
      // Theme configuration...
    }),
    bundler: viteBundler(),
  })
  ```

  ::: warning Language Configuration Required
  Regardless of whether multiple languages are used, the `lang` option must be correctly configured.
  The theme relies on this setting to determine the text language environment.
  :::

* ### Create Homepage Document

  ```md title="README.md"
  ---
  home: true
  ---
  ```

* ### Start Development Server

  ::: npm-to

  ```sh
  npm run docs:dev
  ```

  :::

  VuePress will start a development server at <http://localhost:8080> with hot-reload support for Markdown files.

* ### Installation Complete

# Writing Articles
VuePress fully supports [Standard Markdown Syntax](../markdown/basic.md),
while also allowing page metadata (such as title, creation time, etc.) to be defined via Frontmatter
in [YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f) format.

Additionally, the theme provides extensive [Markdown Extended Syntax](../markdown/extensions.md).
You can not only write HTML directly in Markdown but also use Vue components to enhance content expressiveness.

## Frontmatter Page Configuration

Frontmatter allows you to customize the properties and behavior of each page.
Frontmatter is located at the top of the file, enclosed by `---` delimiters.

```md title="post.md"
<!--[!code ++:5]-->
---
title: Article Title
createTime: 2024/09/08 22:53:34
permalink: /article/9eh4d6ao/
---

Page content starts after the second `---`.
```

::: details What is Frontmatter?
Frontmatter is a configuration block using
[YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f) format, located at the top of a Markdown file and delimited by `---`.

It is recommended to read the [Frontmatter Detailed Guide](../../../../4.教程/frontmatter.md) for the complete syntax specification.
:::

## Automatic Frontmatter Generation

After the development server starts, the theme automatically generates necessary Frontmatter fields for
Markdown files in the documentation source directory, including: **title**, **creation time**, and **permalink**.

This feature reduces the repetitive workload for content creators and provides essential data support for the theme's subsequent functionalities.

```md
---
title: Title
createTime: 2024/09/08 22:53:34
permalink: /article/9eh4d6ao/
---
```

### Title Generation Rules

The theme uses the filename as the article title by default. During parsing, the sequence number and
extension from the [File Naming Convention](#file-naming-convention) are automatically removed.
For example, `1.my-article.md` will generate the title `my-article`.

### Creation Time

The theme uses the file's creation time as the baseline, formatted as `yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss`, to serve as the article creation time.

### Permalink

The **permalink** is the fixed access URL for the article after publication.
Once generated, this link remains constant even if the file path or name changes.

Setting the permalink in advance helps:

* Improve **SEO effectiveness** by avoiding frequent changes to indexed URLs
* Maintain **consistency** in the site's overall link style

### Disabling Automatic Generation

If full manual control over Frontmatter is required, automatic generation can be disabled via [Theme Configuration > autoFrontmatter](../../config/theme.md#autofrontmatter).

```ts title=".vuepress/config.ts" twoslash
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { plumeTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-plume'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: plumeTheme({
    // Completely disable all automatic generation
    // autoFrontmatter: false,

    // Enable specific features as needed
    autoFrontmatter: {
      permalink: true, // Generate permalink
      createTime: true, // Generate creation time
      title: true, // Generate title
    },
    collections: [{
      type: 'post',
      dir: 'blog',
      title: 'Blog',
      // Configure for specific collection
      autoFrontmatter: {
        permalink: true,
        createTime: true,
        title: true
      }
    }]
  })
})
```

## File Organization Conventions

::: info Note
The following examples are based on the baseline file structure from the [Project Structure](./project-structure.md).
:::

The theme provides a flexible file organization approach. You can create Markdown files with any preferred names within the `docs` directory.

### Directory Naming Convention

The theme applies the following rules to directory names within the `docs` directory:

For `post` type collections:

* Directory names serve as article **categories**
* Multi-level directories are supported, with subdirectories acting as children of parent categories

When sorting is required, use the following naming pattern (applicable to all collection types):

```ts :no-line-numbers
const dir = /\d+\.[\s\S]+/
// Format: Number + . + Category Name
// Example: 1.Frontend
```

The numeric part serves as the **sorting basis**. Directories without numbers are sorted according to default rules.

**Example Structure:**

::: file-tree

* docs
  * blog # post type collection
    * 1.Frontend
      * 1.html/
      * 2.css/
      * 3.javascript/
    * 2.Backend/
    * DevOps/
  * typescript # doc type collection
    * 1.Basics
      * 1.Variables.md
      * 2.Types.md
    * 2.Advanced.md
      :::

The theme automatically generates category pages or sidebars based on the directory structure.

### File Naming Convention

File naming follows the same rules as the [Directory Naming Convention](#directory-naming-convention),
providing sorting basis for the [auto-generated sidebar](../../config/notes.md#auto-generated-sidebar) in the notes feature.

## Start Writing

You can now create Markdown files under the `docs` directory to start writing.
For a complete description of Markdown extension features, please refer to the [Extended Syntax Documentation](../markdown/extensions.md).

Since the theme automatically generates article titles by default,
the main content should start with level 2 headings `## Level 2 Heading`.
If `autoFrontmatter.title` is disabled, start with level 1 headings `# Level 1 Heading`.

### Article Tags

Add tags to articles via `frontmatter.tags`:

```md
---
title: My Article
tags:
  - Tag1
  - Tag2
---
```
